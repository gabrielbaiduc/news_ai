        "The mother of a six-year-old girl missing in South Africa since 19 February has been charged with human trafficking and kidnapping.Kelly Smith was charged along with her boyfriend, Jacquen Appollis, and two others, following their arrest.Ms Smith's daughter, Joslin, disappeared outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town.The four accused appeared in court, but were not asked to plead in a case that has transfixed South Africans.A huge crowd gathered outside court, chanting: \"Bring back Joslin.\"The prosecution alleges that Ms Smith instructed Mr Appollis and another of the accused, Stefano van Rhyn, to sell Joslin to a traditional healer for 20,000 rand ($1,000; \u00a3835), the privately owned Citizen newspaper reports.A child goes missing every five hours in South Africa, but most are found.Joslin has not yet been located, despite a massive search operation involving the navy, drones and sniffer dogs.Police said the search for her was continuing.On Saturday, investigators found bloodied clothing in an open field in the area where Joslin disappeared over a fortnight ago.Ms Smith and her co-accused, one of whom has been identified by local media as a traditional healer, have been remanded in custody until 13 March, when a bail application is due to be heard. They have all said they would apply for legal aid.In a widely condemned practice, some traditional healers use body parts to make potions, claiming they can cure people of illnesses or improve their fortunes.Ms Smith had previously told local publication The Daily Voice that she had not given up hope of finding her daughter following her disappearance outside their home in an informal settlement.\"My motherly instincts are telling me my daughter is still alive and in this area. We will find her, I will walk on foot to find her. I will look in every little shack, I'm going to do it by myself if I have to.\"Frantic community members searched sewers and pits in the days following the girl's disappearance. Saldanha Bay Mayor Andr\u00e9 Truter said an angry mob had been raiding homes and accosting neighbours in search of the child.A 100,000 rand reward has been offered to anyone with information on her whereabouts.She was left in the care of Mr Appollis when she went missing.He has previously denied involvement in her disappearance.",
        "Senegal's government has announced that the country's presidential election will take place on 24 March.The announcement follows tension in the West African nation after President Macky Sall postponed the election last month, sparking widespread protests.Parliament has also passed an amnesty law for crimes linked to the protests.The president's opponents had accused him of mounting a constitutional coup but he denies seeking to extend his term of office.Mr Sall's 12 years in power is due to end on 2 April.The announcement of the election date has been welcomed by opposition figures.\"What we are looking forward now is fair, just and transparent elections. That is the last duty that President Macky Sall has to fulfil,\" Aminata Tour\u00e9, a former prime minister under Mr Sall who switched to the opposition, told the BBC's Newsday programme.Senegal has long been seen as one of the most stable democracies in Africa.It is the only country in mainland West Africa that has never had a military coup.Prior to Wednesday's announcement, authorities had attempted to postpone the original 25 February poll to December, which resulted in deadly unrest on the streets.But the Constitutional Council later ruled that the presidential election must take place before 2 April.Earlier on Wednesday evening, Mr Sall dissolved the government and replaced Prime Minister Amadou Ba with Interior Minister Sidiki Kaba.This was so that Mr Ba, the ruling coalition's presidential candidate, could focus on his electoral campaign, the presidency said.President Sall has served two terms as Senegal's leader and when he was first elected in 2012 he promised he would not overstay.In another attempt to defuse political tensions, lawmakers have approved a bill which gives amnesty for all offences \"relating to demonstrations or having political motivations\" that were committed 1 February 2021 to 25 February 2024.Ninety-four members of parliament backed the measure while 49 voted against it.Critics say the law will shield the perpetrators of serious crimes, including members of security forces who killed dozens of protesters, as well as Mr Sall.But the law's supporters say it will benefit the opposition, as it could pave the way for the release of leading opposition politician Ousmane Sonko and thousands of his supporters.Mr Sonko was at the forefront of the campaign against Mr Sall, and was imprisoned in 2023 on what he said were trumped-up charges aimed at barring him from running for president.Despite the latest political reforms, the list of candidates eligible to contest the presidency remains unchanged, meaning Mr Sonko still cannot run for office.Nevertheless vice-president of his Pastef party, Yacine Fall, told the BBC that the announcement of an election date was \"a big relief for the whole country\".\"Unfortunately, Ousmane Sonko had been illegally prevented from being a candidate, but we are still happy to see that Pastef... has a candidate,\" she said.\"We are hopeful and we are convinced that if the campaign is done and due process is put in motion, Pastef will win the election and Bassirou Diomaye will be the next president of Senegal.\"However, Mr Diomaye is currently in prison - he is one of those hoping to be freed - while Pastef has been banned on charges of calling for insurrection.Another leading opposition figure, Karim Wade, is not on the list of approved candidates and so will also not be able to take part in the election which is in just over a fortnight's time.",
        "Three West African countries run by military juntas say they will form a joint force to fight jihadist threats.Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso announced the formation of the force following talks in the Nigerien capital Niamey.Niger's army chief Moussa Salaou Barmou announced it would be operational as soon as possible, without giving details of its size.Groups linked to both Islamic State and al-Qaeda have killed thousands of people in the region in the past year.The military regimes in the three countries have become increasingly close allies in recent months.Last September, they formed a mutual defence pact known as the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), withdrawing from an international force, G5, that was set up to fight Islamists in the region.Violence in West Africa's Sahel region has worsened in recent years despite the military governments' promises to deal with the decade-long conflict with jihadist groups.The three countries have all severed their ties with France, the former colonial power, which for years had a strong military presence across the Sahel.A UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, Minusma, that had been in place for over a decade was also ordered by the country's leaders to withdraw \"without delay\", and completed the exit in December.The military regimes have strengthened ties with Russia, which has moved in to fill the void.They have also announced they were leaving the West African economic bloc Ecowas.They had already been suspended from the bloc, which has been urging the military regimes to ensure a quick return to democratic rule and imposed travel and economic sanctions on them.Some of the sanctions were last month lifted or eased as Ecowas pushed for dialogue.",
        "Zimbabwe's government has condemned fresh sanctions that the US imposed against the country's president and senior officials on Monday.The US accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the others on its list of corruption and human rights abuses.A spokesperson for President Mnangagwa on Wednesday said the accusations were \"defamatory\" and a \"gratuitous slander\" against Zimbabwe's leaders and people.The new sanctions replaced a broader programme introduced two decades ago.The deputy chief secretary in President Mnangagwa's communications team George Charamba demanded that the US promptly lift the \"illegal coercive measures\".\"We condemn these malicious statements as completely uncalled for, defamatory, provocative, and a continuation of wanton hostilities against Zimbabwe by the US government,\" he said in a statement.\"We demand that the Biden administration provides evidence in support of these gratuitous accusations, failure to which the administration must, without any further delay, withdraw them unconditionally.\"Mr Charamba also called on the UN, the African Union and southern African regional bloc Sadc to support Zimbabwe's call for the removal of the sanctions.Zimbabwe has also been critical of the way the US government lifted the old sanctions programme on Monday, saying that Zimbabweans cannot be expected to be grateful for the measure.Mr Charamba said that the ending of the sanctions imposed in the earl;y 2000s \"can never atone for, let alone write off, heinous crimes committed against Zimbabwe and her people\".Those sanctions were targeted at then-President Robert Mugabe and dozens of other high-ranking government officials, whom Washington accused of undermining democracy in the country.Zimbabwe's government has repeatedly blamed the economic tariffs for the country's crippling economic problems, including hyperinflation and high poverty levels.The fresh measures block assets held by President Mnangagwa and the sanctioned officials in the US and further bar them from unofficial travel there.Those on the list include First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri, senior security officials and businesspeople found to have facilitated state corruption.",
        "Fighting is in Anthony Joshua's \"bloodline\", according to his cousin Raymond Ajakaye, who lives in the Nigerian town of Sagamu that is the ancestral home of the Joshua family.The town is expected to grind to a halt on Friday when hundreds of people will assemble to watch special screenings of the British boxer's heavyweight contest against Cameroon's Francis Ngannou - to cheer on the man they see as their own.\"It runs in the family, we're all tough people, from my grandad, my uncles and his dad,\" Ajakaye tells BBC Sport Africa.\"We fought through a lot. This is where I would think he got the [boxing] gift from.\"Located near Lagos in south-west Nigeria, Sagamu has a population of around half a million people.Like the country as a whole, that population skews towards the younger age range, meaning many youngsters have found inspiration in Joshua's family heritage and his success in the ring.How to follow Joshua v Ngannou on BBC Sport Could Joshua v Ngannou winner fight for undisputed title next?Why Nigerians see Joshua as one of their ownSuch has been his impact, the town has its own Anthony Joshua Fan Club, with thousands of followers on social media, while a street has also been renamed in honour of the 34-year-old Olympic and two-time world heavyweight champion.\"The road was called Cinema Road for many years but it was changed by the government in recognition of his [Joshua's] achievements,\" says Ajakaye.\"We have an office set up here to become a meeting point for all his fans.\"Not only does the road serve as a meeting place for acolytes, but there are also plans in place to build a gym to hunt for the next AJ.Anthony Oluwafemi Olaseni Joshua was born in the UK in October 1989 to a Nigerian mother and a father of Nigerian and Irish descent.Although he has always fought under a British flag, he spent part of his childhood in Nigeria, attending a boarding school, and the influence that Africa - and more specifically Nigeria - has had on him is clear for all to see and hear.Joshua has an outline tattoo of the continent on his right shoulder, with Nigeria's border also highlighted, while he has used the music of Nigerian icons like Burna Boy and Femi Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti, to accompany him on previous ring-walks.His fights are shown on specially erected screens in front of the palace of the Akarigbo in Sagamu, the Nigerian town's paramount ruler.\"The Joshua family is well known in this town. His mother is from my domain and we are related as cousins,\" one of the town's traditional rulers, Oba Adewale Osiberu tells BBC Sport Africa.\"AJ is level-headed and committed to what he does. He is very humble and doesn't allow his success to get to his head. Beyond that, he loves to connect with his roots.\"We wish him the best and will continue to pray for him.\"Joshua visited the town three years ago as it opened up again following the Covid-19 pandemic, meeting with Osiberu and other members of his fan club.\"We all have a strong connection, though we don't meet regularly and his homecoming has not been frequent due to his career,\" explains Ajakaye.\"He's a kid with a lot of respect and he's well brought up, respecting his elders.\"When Joshua enters the ring for a headline bout, fight nights in Sagamu have become legendary.Kayode Segun-Okeowo, president of the Anthony Joshua Fan Club, says it has become a tradition for the town to come out to cheer on its adopted son.\"The club was established in 2016 and we have a large fan base for Anthony Joshua here,\" he says.\"We have organised live viewing events for most of his fights and organised victory parties for him.\"My expectation for his next fight is positive. Joshua has defeated better boxers. I don't see him [Ngannou] beating our own Anthony Joshua.\"Every time Joshua takes to the ring, the town of Sagamu goes into a frenzy. Friday will be no different as boxing fans and non-boxing fans alike will gather to watch their favourite son.The meeting between Joshua and Ngannou reignites a long-standing sporting rivalry between Nigeria and Cameroon.But for the people in this region of Nigeria, the message is clear - there can only be one winner.",
        "School children have marked World Book Day by writing a book that will raise funds towards a community library in West Kenya.Cosmic Cats is an anthology of stories by students from St Swithun's Primary School in Kennington, Oxfordshire, and Kenya's Mumias Township Primary School.The project is jointly lead by Abingdon based charity The Nasio Trust and Oxford author Sylvia Vetta.The Kenyan students said the library would help them \"gain more knowledge\".All proceeds from the sale of Cosmic Cats will go towards the library fundraiser.Mrs Vetta said the idea behind the book was that children from both countries write about a subject they would be \"happy with\".She suggested to her granddaughter Alexandra to write a story inspired by cats.Copies of her story were then sent to Mumias Township Primary School is in Kakamega County in Kenya, where the students \"absolutely came up with the challenge\".\"And then the children here responded amazingly.\"The Nasio Trust has been helping vulnerable children and communities in Kakamega for over 20 years.Its founder Nancy Mudenyo Hunt grew up in a village called Musanda and walked 6km every day to get to Mumias School.\"The community we support has no access to books, computers or even a basic space where they can sit and read,\" she said.Mrs Hunt said she felt that would be \"life-changing\" for them because they could improve their numeracy, literacy, and even read books by Kenyan authors.Students from Mumias Township Primary School told the BBC the library would help them \"develop basic skills\", \"gain more knowledge\" and \"spend leisure time reading stories\".Copies of the book can be purchased from The Nasio Trust website and at Mostly Books or The Book Store in Abingdon.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

        "Homophobia is not uncommon in Ghana, where gay sex is already against the law and carries a three-year prison sentence, but now the LGBTQ+ community is feeling terrorised.A new bill, passed by MPs last week, will impose a jail term of up to three years for simply identifying as LGBTQ+ and five years for promoting their activities.\"A relative told me if this bill is passed, any chance he gets, he is going to poison me because I am an abomination to the family,\" Mensah, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, tells the BBC.Dressed in an all-black outfit, the young man in his late teens looks visibly terrified: \"I am very worried anyone can snitch on me, even in my own neighbourhood. It's going to be very hard to live here.\"He has been living for some time with sympathetic friends in Ghana's capital, Accra, since falling out with his family.It is not clear how large the LGBTQ+ community is in Ghana, a religious and traditionally conservative nation, but they tend to help each other out when one of them faces life as an outcast.Mensah says when his mother discovered several years ago that he was attracted to boys, she started taking him to churches for prayers with the hope he would change.\"No friends except my church friends were allowed to see me. I had to study the Bible 24/7, pray and I would sit at the back anytime we went for meetings.\"He says he was practically shunned at home - the wider family would not talk to him and he found their stares unbearable.\"They felt I would have influence on my cousins and the little ones.\"Then in 2020, when the prayers and Bible studies were deemed to have failed, Mensah was excommunicated from his church for being gay.His family were furious - and essentially outed him to their wider circle in an attempt to shame him.\"My family told a lot of my friends that this is who I am, I lost some good opportunities to further my education,\" he says.\"It is very uncomfortable and very sad - these are people I grew up with, and now they don't see the good in me, but they see me as an abomination.\"Mensah was eventually kicked out of the family home - and struggles to hold down a job.Now the softly spoken young man says he spends most of his time indoors to avoid offending people's sensibilities. He wants to be less visible, less seen, less heard.Mensah's experiences are not uncommon.LGBT people are commonly referred to in the local Akan language as \"kojo besia\", literally \"man-woman\". They have always co-existed within Ghanaian communities, although there were occasional attacks.These have become more common in recent years.Kwame, who also requested his name be changed for his safety, is horrified by the passage of the anti-gay bill, saying it will legitimise homophobic attacks, something he has experienced himself.\"I am known to be gay where I live, so anybody that comes close to me - they feel like that person is also gay,\" he tells the BBC about an attack he suffered about 10 years ago.A male friend had visited and when stepping outside to wave him goodbye, some residents ganged up on them.\"They approached us, saying that we are gay and started attacking us. It wasn't just one person, and they took our phones,\" he says.Kwame made an official report to the police, however after weeks of no action he had to live with the reality that he would get no justice.Now his mere existence - if the bill is signed by the president - will be against the law.In his late twenties, Kwame is studying fashion design - but has also faced discrimination in the workplace when someone told his boss about his sexuality.His boss asked him to change his ways and then fired him when he refused. \"I lost my job because I was gay.\"Both Kwame and Mensah are hoping the bill, which has been backed by both of Ghana's two main political parties, will be stopped by a legal challenge.A case has been filed at the Supreme Court and President Nana Akufo-Addo says he will wait for the outcome before taking action on the bill.He has been at pains to assure the diplomatic community that Ghana is committed to upholding human rights.The country's finance ministry is worried about the possible repercussions, saying Ghana could lose a total of $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) in World Bank funding over the next five to six years.Ghana is suffering a major economic crisis and last year had a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The US, UK and human rights groups have condemned the bill, with the US in particular indicating that it would have a chilling effect on foreign investment to Ghana.The West African nation is part of the trade agreement between Africa and the US - the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). Uganda was chucked out of the deal by the US after it passed a controversial anti-homosexuality law last year.Kwame and Mensah are considering leaving Ghana as the situation has been so inflamed by politicians - the country feels like a more dangerous place for them.\"Where I am living is a very crowded area, so when your issue comes up everyone gets to find out, I'm actually scared. I will have to leave and go settle somewhere else,\" he says.Mensah agrees: \"I feel like relocating from the country itself to any country which is safe for me to live in.\"I have to count my steps to make sure I don't offend anyone. I have to live like a refugee in my own country.\"",
        "Indian-administered Kashmir has been transformed economically since it was stripped of its semi-autonomous status, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.Security was tight for his first trip to the Muslim-majority region since he made the controversial change in 2019.\"I am working hard to win your hearts,\" he told a rally in Srinagar, weeks before general elections are held.An armed revolt against Indian rule in the disputed territory has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s.Kashmir was divided after India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947. The two nuclear-armed states both claim the region in its entirety and have fought two wars over it in the decades since.\"People used to ask who will tour Jammu-Kashmir - now thousands are,\" Mr Modi told thousands of people packed into Srinagar's Bakshi stadium.\"Friends, Jammu and Kashmir is touching new heights of development because it is breathing freely now. This freedom has come after the removal of Article 370, which had been a barrier.\"He announced projects worth 64bn rupees ($774m; \u00a3607m) to support local agriculture and tourism. His comments about Article 370 - a constitutional provision which had granted significant autonomy to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir - echo what he said last month on a visit to mostly-Hindu Jammu.Mr Modi's decision to impose direct federal rule angered many Kashmiris.One local leader said that almost none of those attending Mr Modi's rally would be going of their own free will. \"Employees who don't show up are being threatened with disciplinary action,\" former Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah alleged in a message on X, formerly Twitter.Analysts say the message Mr Modi wants to send is that things are back to normal in the territory, despite incidents of violence and high levels of unemployment. His government talks about a new era of peace and development since 2019, but many locals and critics say they have faced a crackdown on civil liberties and press freedom.His government is keen to talk up projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars that it says are part of a plan to integrate Kashmir's economy with the rest of India. Until Jammu and Kashmir's special status was removed, outsiders could not buy land to do business there.Many locals say they have yet to see the benefits of such projects.Revoking part of the constitution that allowed Indian-administered Kashmir special status had been a poll promise and Mr Modi's government announced the move soon after he won re-election in 2019.Article 370 had granted privileges to Jammu and Kashmir including the right to have its own flag, legislature, constitution and laws.It was the only Muslim-majority state in India. After the abrogation of Article 370, its 12 million people were divided into two federally-administered territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and remote, mountainous Ladakh.Tens of thousands of extra Indian troops were deployed ahead of the move, which shocked locals and upended normal life in the region -  but was backed by many of Mr Modi's supporters. Schools and colleges were shut in the former state, telephone and internet services suspended and local political leaders placed under house arrest or moved to jails in other parts of India.In December, India's Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370 - but said the government had promised to restore Jammu-Kashmir's statehood and should do so as soon as possible.Analysts say Mr Modi's visit will set the tone for the BJP's campaign in the region for the coming general election, due by May.Most of those the BBC spoke to ahead of the visit were critical, although one or two were prepared to wait and see what the PM said.One worker at a private firm in Srinagar told the BBC that removing Article 370 had been a \"great injustice\" and he would not go to the PM's rally. \"When did he ever talk about the atrocities being committed against Muslims across the country?\"Another person said: \"Electricity rates are skyrocketing. One has to put in so much effort even to get rice. Inflation is skyrocketing. Why should we go to listen to the speech of such a government?\"Prior to Mr Modi's visit, the streets of Srinagar were cleaned and bill boards put up to welcome him.Thousands of security personnel were deployed to ensure security and check people and vehicles moving in and out of Srinagar. The presence of Indian forces is contentious, with security personnel accused of numerous human rights abuses and other excesses over decades.Thursday's visit was one among many events Mr Modi will attend before general election voting dates are announced.

        "Three crew members have been killed in a Houthi missile strike on a cargo ship off southern Yemen, its owners and the US say - the first deaths caused by the group's attacks on merchant vessels.The Barbados-flagged True Confidence was abandoned after Wednesday's attack, which inflicted significant damage.Two of the sailors who died were Filipinos and the other was Vietnamese.The Houthis say their attacks are in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.A military spokesman for the Iran-backed group claimed it targeted True Confidence because it was \"American\" - something the owners denied.The US military's Central Command (Centcom) condemned the Houthis' \"reckless attacks\", which it said had \"disrupted global trade and taken the lives of international seafarers\".Hours after the attack, US forces conducted strikes on two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Yemen, which Centcom said presented an imminent threat to US Navy ships in the region. Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that two strikes targeted the airport in the Red Sea city of Hudaydah.The attack on True Confidence occurred around 12:30 (09:30 GMT) on Wednesday, when the bulk carrier was in the Gulf of Aden, about 50 nautical miles (93km) south-west of the city of Aden, according to its owners.The vessel was manned by a crew of 20, comprising one Indian, four Vietnamese and 15 Filipino nationals. Three armed guards - two from Sri Lanka and one from Nepal - were also on board.A Centcom statement said the 183m-long bulk carrier was hit by an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen.It published an aerial photograph showing significant damage to the bridge and accommodation at the stern of the stricken vessel, on the port side.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said that before the attack True Confidence had been contacted over VHF radio by a group calling itself the \"Yemeni navy\" and told to change course.Nearby vessels then reported a loud bang and a large plume of smoke.The Indian Navy's spokesperson said INS Kolkata, a destroyer deployed in the region as part of a US-led naval taskforce, arrived at the scene on Wednesday afternoon and rescued 21 crew members using a helicopter and boats.Indian sailors provided critical medical aid to the injured and evacuated them to Djibouti on Wednesday evening, the spokesperson added.A video posted online by the navy showed a fire on board True Confidence and several of its crew members being winched onto helicopters from life rafts.On Thursday morning, a spokesperson for True Confidence's owner and managers put out a statement confirming that one Vietnamese and two Filipino crew members were killedAnother two Filipino crew members had suffered serious injuries and were being treated at a hospital in Djibouti, it said.\"Owners and managers offer their heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this tragic attack and wish for a speedy and full recovery of those who are in hospital.\"The statement said True Confidence was currently \"drifting well away from land\" and that salvage arrangements were being made.It had been sailing from China to the Red Sea ports of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Aqaba in Jordan with a cargo of steel products and trucks.The statement also said the vessel was owned by True Confidence Shipping SA, which is registered to an address in Liberia, and operated by Third January Maritime Ltd in Greece.\"There is no current connection with any US entity,\" it added.Maritime data provider Lloyd's List Intelligence said True Confidence had links to by US-based Oaktree Capital Management before 24 February.It quoted Oaktree as saying it no longer had any association with the vessel, but that the change of ownership \"had not been updated in several shipping databases and is thought to have been used by the Houthis as part of its targeting criteria\".Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Wednesday night that its forces had targeted \"the American ship True Confidence\" after the crew \"rejected warning messages from the Yemeni naval forces\".\"The Yemeni armed forces persist in upholding their religious, moral and humanitarian duties in supporting the oppressed Palestinian people, and their operations in the Red and Arab Seas will not stop until the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,\" he added.The US State Department said Washington would continue to hold the Houthis accountable and called on governments around the world to do the same.\"The Houthis have continued to launch these reckless attacks with no regard for the well-being of innocent civilians who are transiting through the Red Sea and now they have unfortunately and tragically killed innocent civilians,\" spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said he was \"appalled to hear about the deaths\" and condemned the Houthis' \"reckless and indiscriminate attacks\"\"We will continue to stand up for freedom of navigation and back our words with actions.\"After nearly four months of sustained drone and missile attacks by the Houthis against shipping passing through the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea a fatal attack was perhaps, as the British Embassy stated, inevitable.The US-led naval taskforce has been shooting down as many of these missiles and drones as it can but there are simply too many for them to destroy every single one.The Houthis seem to have an inexhaustible supply of them. This calls into question the efficacy of the US-led campaign of air strikes that has been targeting Houthi launch sites, ammo depots and Command and Control posts.Now that the Houthi attacks have turned deadly there are bound to be calls to step up retaliation against them, expanding the range of targets inside Yemen. But this in turn risks escalation in a region already tense due to the humanitarian situation in Gaza.On Tuesday, US forces shot down a ballistic missile and three UAVs launched from Yemen at the destroyer USS Carney. They also destroyed three anti-ship missiles and three unmanned surface vessels (USVS), or sea drones, in later strikes.Meanwhile, on Monday the Indian Navy helped put out a fire on board the container ship MSC Sky II, which its operator said had been hit by a missile.On Sunday, a Belize-flagged cargo ship, Rubymar, sank in the Red Sea two weeks after hit by missiles fired by Houthis. It was the first ship to have been sunk since the Houthi attacks began in November.The Rubymar was near the Bab al-Mandab Strait, which connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea, when it was attacked. The crew was rescued and the vessel began slowly taking on water.It was carrying a cargo of 21,000 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, which the US military said presented an environmental risk in the Red Sea.",
        "Thailand has revoked the visa of a Swiss man who faced growing backlash after reports that he allegedly kicked a local woman sitting on the steps near his villa in Phuket.Urs Fehr and his Thai wife Khanuengnit said they thought she was intruding on their property. They later apologised.Hundreds of angry locals later gathered in front of their seaside villa on Sunday demanding Mr Fehr's expulsion.More than 100,000 foreigners are estimated to have settled in Phuket.The island is one of Thailand's most popular hotspots, with millions of tourists visiting each year.According to local reports, the incident on 24 February unfolded after 45-year-old Mr Fehr, the managing director of an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, kicked Thandao Chandam in her back while she and her friend sat on the steps outside their rented villa.Ms Khanuengnit also allegedly berated Ms Thandao, who works as a doctor in Phuket.Mr Fehr said he believed Ms Thandao and her companion were intruders, and accused them of trespassing on his property. He also claimed that he did not kick Ms Thandao but had slipped while walking towards her, according to Bangkok Post.The incident sparked an angry backlash amongst locals, with many urging authorities to revoke Mr Fehr's visa and also demanding the restoration of public access to the beach near his property.\"It turns out that foreigners are occupying too many areas. Please resolve this,\" Bangkok Post quoted one of the protesters as saying.An investigation later found that the villa's steps were built illegally on public land. Authorities have ordered for them to be removed.The doctor has filed a complaint with police over the incident, and authorities said on Wednesday that he has been charged with assault.Immigration officials said they will detain Fehr, but he can remain in Thailand for the time being to defend himself in the assault case.Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said after the incident that he has instructed the police and tourism ministry to step up measures to ensure foreigners comply with Thailand's laws.",
        "Singapore has charged two men with cheating for sneaking three people into a Taylor Swift concert without tickets.Yang Chenguang allegedly distracted security staff by talking to them while Li Xiao Wei held onto a turnstile to let the trio in, authorities said.The incident happened last Monday, the third of Swift's six sold-out shows in the South East Asian city-state.Tickets to the show are highly coveted as Singapore is the only stop of Swift's Eras Tour in the region.The dates had sold out months before and desperate fans from as far as China turn to resellers to secure their seats. Before Singapore, Swift played in Japan and Australia.Singapore has some of the strictest laws in the world and anyone convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years.A third man who was arrested with Yang and Li is under investigation and has yet to be charged, Singapore police said in a statement on Tuesday.One of the men that the group snuck into the show is Chinese influencer Yang Junhao, who claims he unknowingly got fake tickets.\"This is me after being told I bought fake tickets, and was brought out [of the concert] to be interrogated by the police... I pleaded with the police to let me stay outside the venue so that I can hear Taylor's voice,\" Yang said in a video on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, which also featured him in a pastel purple outfit, looking dejected.\"I spent 12,000 yuan (\u00a31,300; $1,700) on the ticket and didn't know it was fake even after I entered the concert. I only realised it after officers brought us out... I am also a victim, I am stuck in Singapore and assisting in the investigation. It's a difficult situation,\" he wrote in a comment posted on Wednesday night.Security personnel at the Singapore Sports Hub, where Swift's concerts were held, said they had detained several people who tried to trespass into the concert venue on Monday.Concert organisers said they would work closely with the police \"to ensure the safety and security of the public\".Singapore struck a deal with Swift's concert promoters to host the show exclusively for South East Asia. The agreement is reportedly worth millions of dollars, according to reports. This has sowed tension among its neighbours, including Thailand and the Philippines.Swift has three more shows in Singapore before she wraps up her tour in the region.",
        "An Afghan judge who has been forced to go into hiding from the Taliban was wrongly refused relocation to the UK, the High Court has ruled.The anonymous claimant prosecuted Taliban and Islamic State group members, and has since avoided an assassination attempt, the court heard.The UK government argued he had not worked closely enough with the UK in Afghanistan to qualify for relocation.A UK government spokesperson says officials are \"considering\" the ruling.The Afghan judge is currently in hiding in an unspecified third country with his wife and children, two of whom are in poor health, it emerged in court.He lives with the constant \"risk that they may be forcibly returned to Afghanistan\", according to a ruling in his favour.Zoe Cooley, the claimant's solicitor, said the government had a \"moral, as well as a legal, responsibility to bring our client and his family to safety\".The ruling does not automatically qualify him for relocation but does mean the government must now reassess his application in light of the court's findings.Ms Cooley called on the UK government to act \"very swiftly\" to bring the judge and his family to the UK before it was \"too late\".The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme was set up to offer people who worked for or with the UK government in Afghanistan a path to move to the UK.It is aimed at those who could be exposed to retribution by the Taliban, which re-seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, due to their association with international forces involved in the invasion.The Afghan judge who brought the High Court case first applied to ARAP in August 2021 but was rejected in March 2022 - a decision upheld by an appeals panel in May 2023.The government officials responsible for reviewing the application effectively ruled that he did not directly work for or with the UK government and was therefore not eligible.Now High Court judge Mr Justice Julian Knowles has ruled that decision was \"irrational\" and based on \"plainly faulty\" reasoning as the Afghan judge's activities \"personally and directly\" had helped to further the UK's goals in Afghanistan.The High Court heard the judge asked for help to leave Afghanistan during the August 2021 evacuation but \"did not receive a reply\" and was left in the country.He served as a senior judge for six years in an area which saw some of the heaviest fighting and counter-insurgency during the Afghanistan war.The court heard he oversaw cases involving murder, violence against women, terrorism, kidnapping, drug smuggling and corruption.The perpetrators were often members of the Taliban and the Islamic State group.When the Taliban had surrounded his home city in 2021 during its rapid campaign to seize control of Afghanistan, the judge had to be \"air-lifted out of the region by military aircraft\" for his safety, the High Court was told.Mr Justice Knowles accepted the claimant's evidence that the Taliban had had informants on the court's staff during his time as a judge - some of whom now hold high-ranking positions in the government.Some of the people the judge sentenced in Afghanistan have since \"obtained high positions in the present Taliban regime\".The judge was involved in cases where suspects were apprehended after operations based on intelligence provided by \"international forces\" operating in Afghanistan.Taliban operatives have \"visited family members seeking [the] whereabouts\" of the judge, the court heard.A partial statement from the judge was published by the court on Monday as part of the ruling. It read: \"I am struggling a lot and my wife and children now have a very hard life. What we are going through is very difficult.\"The situation here is much worse than the Taliban are admitting to publicly. We are aware of constant killings and assassinations and terror.\"The media and the journalists have no access to this and so it is not being properly reported... As a Chief Judge I know I will be killed and my family too.\"The judge's solicitor told the BBC his work had come at \"immense personal risk\" and he \"was the subject of repeated threats, including a documented assassination attempt upon him in March 2020\".In his written judgement, Mr Justice Knowles said the grounds on which the panel had rejected the judge's application for relocation amounted to \"semantic hair-splitting\".He said the MoD had failed to explain why working to uphold the rule of law in Afghanistan was \"not sufficient to count as working 'alongside' and in 'support'\" of the UK government.He continued: \"[The judge] performed significant activities which were closely aligned with the democracy-building and rule of law building activities of the UK government... He made significant contributions to the building of a properly functioning criminal justice system in the fields of terrorism, anti-narcotics, and anti-corruption, among others.\"It is unclear how long it will take for the judge's application to be reassessed.Responding to the ruling, a government spokesperson said: \"We note the outcome of the court proceedings in relation to an ARAP-related case, which we are considering. It is inappropriate to comment further at this time.\"We continue to honour our commitment to those brave Afghans that supported the UK mission in Afghanistan.\"So far, we have brought around 27,900 people to safety from Afghanistan, including over 15,800 people from the ARAP scheme, including over 3,000 since October 2023.\"",
        "A former Google software engineer has been charged by the US with stealing trade secrets about artificial intelligence (AI) while secretly working for two Chinese companies.Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted in California on four charges and arrested on Wednesday.The Chinese national allegedly stole more than 500 confidential files.If convicted he faces up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count.A lawyer for Mr Ding could not be identified to comment on the case, local media reported.The information he is accused of taking relates to the infrastructure of Google's supercomputing data centres, which are used to host and train large AI models.According to the indictment, Mr Ding was hired by Google in 2019 and his responsibilities included developing this software.He allegedly began uploading information stored in Google's network to a personal Google account in May 2022. These uploads continued periodically for a year, the indictment reads.Meanwhile, he is said to have spent several months in China working for Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology - a start-up tech company that approached him. The indictment says he was offered $14,800 (\u00a311,620) per month to be the company's Chief Technology Officer.He is also alleged to have started his own tech firm, Shanghai Zhisuan Technology, which had a focus on AI and machine learning, and made himself the CEO.The BBC has contacted Rongshu, while Zhisuan could not be immediately reached for comment.Prosecutors allege Mr Ding never told Google about his work for either company.The indictment states that he applied to a China-based organisation to help develop this business and presented it at an investor conference in China in November 2023.The following month, he was flagged by Google trying to upload more files to his personal computer while in China, but Mr Ding told Google's investigator it was to provide proof that he worked for the tech giant.When he returned to the US and without Google's knowledge, Mr Ding is said to have booked a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Beijing, before resigning on 26 December.Days later, Google once again became suspicious after learning about his actions at the conference and suspended his access - searching his activity history to reveal the unauthorised uploads.Google spokesman Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda said the company has \"strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets,\" adding that the company quickly alerted the authorities when it found evidence of alleged wrongdoing.US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Wednesday that Linwei Ding was seeking to enrich himself by covertly working for companies that were \"seeking an edge in the AI technology race\".\"The Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,\" Mr Garland said.FBI Director Christopher Wray said Mr Ding's alleged actions \"are the latest illustration of the lengths\" companies in China will go to, \"to steal American innovation\".The US and China have been engaged in a bitter trade battle in recent years, with both sides attempting to gain a competitive edge over the other.The dispute has seen both countries impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of one another's goods.Trade relations have worsened under the Biden administration, with the two sides imposing new barriers on trade, including restrictions on computer chip exports.",
        "It would take a remarkable acting performance to rival Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett on screen.But that's exactly what untried child prodigy Aswan Reid has done in her latest movie, critics say.Barely 11 years old when The New Boy was shot in the dusty South Australian outback in 2022, Reid's audition was the very first tape the film's creators looked at.\"He's absolutely magnetic. We were so lucky to find him,\" Blanchett tells the BBC's Today programme.\"[He's] a Kiwirrkurra boy from the border of the Northern Territory and Western Australia - who had not only never been off Country, he'd never been on a film set. But yet, he learnt more in two days about the film industry than I'd learnt in almost 30 years.\"Variety calls Reid the film's \"secret weapon\" while The Guardian wrote that he \"delivers Australian cinema's most impressive child performance for some time\" - an assessment rubberstamped last month, when he took home the prize for Best Lead Actor at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards.Reid plays the film's titular character - a nine-year-old Aboriginal orphan with mysterious supernatural powers, whose arrival at a remote monastery in the dead of night sends the place into turmoil.The fable, which is out in UK cinemas from 15 March, is set in 1940s Australia and touches on one of the nation's darkest chapters.From the mid-1800s until 1970, successive generations of Indigenous children - estimated to be in the tens of thousands - were forcibly removed from their families and cut off from their culture, under policies aimed at assimilation.The film's backers say it \"explores spirituality, culture and colonisation in a way we haven't seen on screen before\".For writer and director Warwick Thornton, who is also a giant of the nation's industry, it's a deeply personal story.At the age of 11, the Kaytetye man was sent from his home in Alice Springs to a remote missionary-style school run by Benedictine monks in Western Australia.Though Thornton is not himself a member of the Stolen Generations, he says the movie is about the \"cost of survival\", a theme which would resonate with \"any Indigenous person through the last 250 years of colonisation\".\"Your lore, your culture and everything has just been completely obliterated to extinction in a strange way,\" he said in the film's press notes.\"You have to adapt in this new world that is like a plague, like a virus that has completely taken over your life and shut down everything that you've believed in.\"Blanchett - who plays a renegade nun - has said she's long wanted to work with Thornton and when she read the script, she was determined to have it for her production company Dirty Films.They first began discussing the project during the pandemic, but it had been written by Thornton almost two decades earlier.\"It was so personal that he put it in his sock drawer, his proverbial sock drawer, and left it there.\"But Blanchett too was drawn to the project for personal reasons.Her father had died when she was just 10 years old, and - despite having no religious background - she found herself seeking comfort in the rituals and community of the Catholic Church.\"I was looking for some sense of understanding of what I had perceived as the disappearance of my father - which seemed some inverse miracle. How could he be there one day and gone the next?\" she says.\"I was, I think in a very simplistic way, hoping that the hand of God would come down and tell me, you know, 'Your father's playing golf. You'll see him in a few years' time.' But of course, that didn't happen.\"She initially had no idea about Thornton's childhood, but they soon bonded over their similar brushes with faith as youngsters.\"His work is often quite savage and brutal, but this is a very personal story about his own experience,\" Blanchett says.\"And so, we found this connection.\"Originally about a monk and an Indigenous boy, it was Blanchett's husband and collaborator Andrew Upton who suggested putting a nun in charge of the monastery - a role usually reserved for men.\"We have a nun who's officiating mass and we have people who were all dislocated from their metaphysical country, and so I found it absolutely intriguing to go into the exploration of what it would mean to be a nun in those particular set of circumstances,\" Blanchett says.Many of the film's themes are very much still live issues in Australia too.Indigenous children continue to be removed from their families at record rates by child protective services.And when the film was released there last year, the nation was in the grips of a referendum on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which was decisively rejected.Critics of the defeated proposal argued the idea was divisive and would have created special \"classes\" of citizens.But Blanchett describes it as a \"missed opportunity\" for the country to grapple with its complex past, and those policies that have contributed to the \"eradication of Indigenous culture\".\"So many positives could have come out of it,\" she says.\"I think it's to our detriment that we have not been able to really adhere to the deep-time, vibrant history that came before white settlement.\"",
        "An Australian man has been charged with murdering a woman who was last seen leaving her home a month ago.Samantha Murphy has not been seen since she went out from her home in Ballarat, Victoria, for a run on 4 February.Her disappearance led to a huge search, but police have still found no trace of the 51-year-old mother of three.A 22-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday at his house in Ballarat, about 115km (70 miles) northwest of Melbourne. He is yet to enter a plea.On Thursday police said he had deliberately attacked Ms Murphy on the day of her disappearance in a bushland area where she was known to exercise, near her East Ballarat home.Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told reporters that the suspect had not disclosed the location of Ms Murphy's body, and that detectives did not believe he was previously known to her.Mr Patton described it as a \"tragic outcome\" for her family.Just before she went missing, Ms Murphy was seen on security cameras in her driveway wearing a maroon running shirt and black leggings.After she failed to return that afternoon, authorities began scouring nearby areas and examining thousands of hours of CCTV footage.Ms Murphy's phone, Apple watch and headphones - which she was carrying at the time - have still not been located.Police thanked the local community on Thursday for their help with the case.\"I know that Samantha's disappearance has had a profound impact on the Ballarat community,\" Det Acting Supt Mark Hatt said.In a plea to the public last month, Ms Murphy's family described her as a strong woman who would be determined to return home.\"Mum we love you so much and we miss you. We need you at home with us. Please come home soon,\" her daughter Jess Murphy said.Police had previously warned it was unlikely that Ms Murphy was still alive.",
        "In eastern Ukraine, the tide of this war hasn't just changed - it's coming in fast.\"We know what's coming,\" says Mariya as she packs up the TV in her flat in Kostyantynivka. She's having it delivered to Kyiv before making the journey there with her son.\"We're tired all day [and suffer] moods and panic attacks. It's constantly depressing, and we're scared.\"In February, Russia captured the strategic town of Avdiivka. Since then, the invaders have advanced further west, and taken several villages.Ukraine says its forces are \"holding on\". But Russian troops are now attacking in five areas along the 1,100km (700 mile) front line.Over 1.2 million people - or two thirds of the population - have left the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region since Russia's full scale invasion two years ago.And it's here in the eastern Donetsk region that Ukraine's defenders are being tested the most.People in cities like Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk are now facing a fast-approaching front line, and even occupation.Mariya and her mother Tetyana are finding life increasingly difficult as the Russians advance closer.Their city is littered with signs of the approaching threat 30km (19 miles) away.Almost every street has a damaged building. Workers replace gold panels on a church after they were blown off by a missile strike on the neighbouring train station, now destroyed.Anxiety fills the cold air in this town, once part of the industrial heartland of the former Soviet Union. Russia slowly destroys Ukraine's cities as it tries to take them. That's what is feared the most here.Mariya explains that her mother Tetyana is staying, but she's confident she'll follow her eventually.\"I've already left twice, what's the point?\" says a defiant Tetyana from her apartment around the corner. She gives us slippers to wear around her home, which explains why it's spotless.\"It's scary everywhere. The whole country is on fire.\"Her eyes moisten. It's one thing to stay in your home for as long as you can, it's another to risk death or Russian occupation.While the whole of Ukraine is a war zone, the Donetsk region - along with four others - is a battlefield. When you weave through its dense forest and expansive, rugged terrain, you always feel like you're approaching the coal face of this conflict.You can hear heavy fire from as far as 40 km away, so the distant sound of artillery is constant. From one vantage point you can see the erosion of Ukrainian territory.Plumes of smoke come from the directions of Avdiivka, a town Russia has recently taken, and Horlivka, which it's controlled since 2014.Russia is using its size, air superiority and deeper ammunition reserves to keep pushing, at a time when Western military aid to Ukraine is running low or being held up by domestic politics.Nearby lies a wide valley with several reservoirs. It's this natural landscape which Ukraine says will allow its forces to \"stabilise\" the front line.Perhaps after chaotic withdrawals in the past, Ukrainian generals are willing to temporarily concede territory in the hope it can be liberated in the long term.Across the front line there is a small minority of people labelled as \"Zhdun\" by the Ukrainians. It's a derogatory word which means \"waiters\", referring to those who are pro-Russian and waiting to be occupied.It doesn't apply to everyone who ignores offers of evacuation. Some just refuse to abandon their homes and have got used to the constant danger.Valeriy isn't one of them. After his home in the town of Toretsk was almost shelled twice, he's taking his belongings and grandson Denys to a pickup point.With the Russians just 5km away, their neighbours wish them well but still refuse to leave. The pair then board an armoured police vehicle.\"I've lived my life already,\" the 67-year-old tells us at the other end of his journey in Kostyantynivka. \"But I need to save the little one.\"\"I worked in the mine for 20 years so I'm not afraid of anything, but I'm worried for him,\" he adds.Denys, who's 14, nods approvingly. \"My last friend left three weeks ago,\" he says.Evacuation from front-line settlements is compulsory for families with children. Despite that 15 children still remain in Toretsk.Anton Pron from the White Angels police evacuation squad, who helps evacuate people away from front-line towns, tells us the situation is worsening every day.\"There's constant shelling and artillery,\" he says. \"The enemy's aviation is working all the time. The Russians drop bombs on residential houses.\"These days, the train station in the nearby city of Kramatorsk is the last stop for arriving troops and increasingly, departing civilians laden with bags.Distant rumbles of artillery serve either as a sobering welcome or a reason to leave. Couples hold long embraces on a platform flanked by freight trains which provide protection in case of a missile strike.At least 61 people were killed by one here in 2022. Shrapnel marks are still scorched onto the pavement.We meet Alla, who's waiting for her train to Kyiv. \"A year ago, we thought we'd get help from the West and that our counter offensive would work, but not anymore,\" she says.\"People used to believe, but not now.\"Ukraine hopes its eastern lands will one day be somewhere safe to live again. Right now it's unclear what these departing passengers will be returning to.Should its Russian invaders gain more momentum in the Donetsk region, the question of where they will stop will be increasingly difficult to answer.Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Scarlett Barter",
        "Gangs pushing for the ouster of Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry have been setting fire to police stations in the capital, Port-au-Prince.The police station located in the busy open-air Salomon market is the latest to be targeted, according to local media.The gangs in the violence-wracked city stepped up their attacks when Mr Henry left for a regional summit last week.The unrest has paralysed air traffic, which has prevented his return.Mr Henry attempted to fly back to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday but ended up in the US territory of Puerto Rico instead.He could not land in the Haitian capital because its international airport was closed as soldiers repelled attempts by gunmen to seize it.Civil aviation authorities in the neighbouring Dominican Republic also turned the prime minister's plane away, saying that they had not been provided with the necessary flight plan.Mr Henry has not given any public statements since he visited Kenya, where he was trying to salvage a deal for the African country to lead a multi-national force to help restore order in Haiti.Gangs in the capital took advantage of his absence to unleash a series of co-ordinated attacks.Among their targets was the airport - which they want to control to prevent Mr Henry from flying back in - and two prisons, from which they freed thousands of inmates.They have also set the peace court in Croix-des-Bouquets on fire and looted or torched more than 20 other buildings, according to a tally compiled by The National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH).At least six police officers have been killed while the National Police Academy has also been destroyed.The bodies of several prisoners were also left lying on the streets after the storming of the National Penitentiary.The violence has caused Haiti's humanitarian crisis to deteriorate even further.Aid groups estimate that more than 15,000 people have fled their homes in the past week.The UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Haiti, Ulrika Richardson, told the BBC's Newshour programme the situation on the ground was \"extremely dire and very alarming\".\"We have big parts of the capital paralysed: schools are closed, many hospitals have had to close, either because of a lack of equipment or simply that staff cannot get to work,\" she said.The gangs have not said what their aim is beyond the ouster of Mr Henry.Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Ch\u00e9rizier, a former police officer who leads an alliance of gangs called G9, has threatened that if Mr Henry does not step down there will be a \"civil war\" which he said could end in \"genocide\".Caribbean nations as well as the US have urged Mr Henry to take steps to \"finalize a political accord\".Irfaan Ali, the president of Guyana who is currently chairing regional body Caricom, said there had to be \"a political solution to anchor any stabilization of security and humanitarian efforts\".In a video message, Mr Ali said that Caricom had not been able \"to reach any form of consensus between stakeholders in Haiti\" despite round-the-clock efforts to get the government and key figures in the opposition, private sector, civil society and religious organisations to agree on the way forward.",
        "Metropolitan Police officers have travelled to Trinidad to speak to the killer of Muriel McKay, in a bid to find her body.Ms McKay was abducted in 1969, mistaken for the then wife of Rupert Murdoch, and held to ransom for \u00a31m at a Hertfordshire farm.Her body has yet to be found but one of her killers recently admitted to burying her body behind a barn.The Met Police said \"we are still working to recover her remains\".Det Supt Katherine Goodwin said the force had \"reviewed and assessed\" information gathered by the family of Ms McKay to \"determine the next steps in our investigation, which includes whether a further search is appropriate\".Ms McKay was the wife of Mr Murdoch's deputy, Alick McKay, and was taken from her home in London on 29 December 1969.Brothers Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein were convicted of her kidnap and murder, but while Arthur died in prison in 2009, Nizamodeen Hosein now lives in Trinidad, where he was deported after serving his sentence.Mark Dyer, the grandson of Ms McKay, said the Met Police told him they had taken Hosein \"into custody for interviews\" over the past two days.He said the sessions were described as \"productive\", adding: \"We're keeping our fingers crossed that Nizam will give his best and honest disclosure to assist the recovery of my grandmother.\"Mr Dyer is keen for detectives to carry out a new search, after a failed attempt in April 2022 at Stocking Farm near Bishop's Stortford.The police said the search was \"extensive\" but the family - and Hosein - believe it was too limited and that officers looked in the wrong place.Mr Dyer said Hosein had expressed disbelief that her body was not found in 1970.Hosein denied murdering Ms McKay, but told her family he was in the room when she died.Mr Dyer said: \"He confirmed the time of death, we showed him pictures of the lounge and he said 'yes, she died there when she saw you all on television' during an appeal and that she had a seizure.\"Det Supt Goodwin said: \"We understand how frustrating and difficult this is for Muriel's family.\"We recently met to speak to them and gather information obtained during their visit to Trinidad. We are grateful for their time and assistance.\"In order to help us further, officers have flown to Trinidad to make further inquiries.\"We remain in contact with the family and will keep them updated.\"Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

        "Police in Ottawa are investigating the deaths of including four children and two adults found dead inside a home as homicides.Officers were responding to an emergency call placed at approximately 22:52 local time (03:52 GMT) on 6 March when they found the six people.The home is located in a suburb about 17km (10 miles) southwest of the Canadian capital.In a statement, Ottawa police said one arrest had been made.Police said at least one person had been taken to hospital in the Ottawa area with serious but not life-threatening injuries,\"This is a tragic and complex investigation, and investigative teams remain on Berrigan Drive,\" the police said in a statement. They added that there was no threat to public safety.Local news reports that there were police cruisers parked outside the home in Barrhaven.Identities of the deceased have not been released.

        "US Supreme Court justices grappled with the mechanics of bump stocks on Wednesday as they weighed whether to lift a ban on the gun accessory.Fitting a bump stock to a rifle enables the weapon to fire hundreds of bullets per minute.The Trump administration banned the devices by classifying them as machine guns after they were used in the deadliest mass shooting in US history.Under the 1986 National Firearms Act, owning a machine gun is mostly legal.The law prohibits the transfer or possession of machine guns made after 19 May 1986, the effective prohibition date.However, transfer or possession of machine guns lawfully obtained before that date is legal.A Texas resident and gun shop owner Michael Cargill has challenged the ban on bump stocks, saying the government has interpreted what qualifies as a machine gun too broadly.The case has now reached America's highest court.It is illegal to modify the internal components of semi-automatic rifles - which typically manage about 60 aimed shots per minute - to make them fully automatic, but gun owners can legally buy accessories to increase the rate of fire.The bump stock harnesses a rifle's recoil to rapidly fire multiple rounds. It replaces the weapon's stock, which is held against the shoulder, and allows the gun to slide back and forward between the user's shoulder and trigger finger. That motion - or \"bump\"- lets the gun fire without the user having to move their trigger finger.At Wednesday's hearing, both liberal and conservative justices seemed to struggle with some of the more technical aspects of the case - about the function and application of bump stocks, as well as the statutes that define and ban machine guns.Speaking to Mr Cargill's lawyer, liberal justice Elena Kagan asked how a gun with a bump stock could be differentiated from a machine gun.She said a machine gun needed continued pressure on a trigger, while a bump stock needed continuous pressure on a barrel, adding: \"I can't understand how anybody could think that those two things should be treated differently.\"But conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh pointed out that the two presidential administrations before Donald Trump's had found that rifles with bump stocks were not considered machine guns under the relevant federal statute. \"That's reason for pause,\" Justice Kavanaugh said.Another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, highlighted another problem for the Biden administration, which has found itself defending the Trump-era ban: that Congress had not acted to ban bump stocks itself.\"Intuitively, I am entirely sympathetic to your argument. I mean, it seems like, yes, this is functioning like a machine gun would,\" she said. But she asked why Congress had not acted \"to make this covered more clearly\".Wednesday's case is linked to a 2017 mass shooting, when a gunman opened fire at a concert in Las Vegas, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds. It was the deadliest shooting the country has ever experienced.Officials determined that the attacker had attached bump stocks - which were then legal but controversial - onto 12 of his semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, the same rate as many machine guns.Political pressure grew to outlaw the relatively new devices, which could be obtained without the extensive background checks required for purchasing automatic weapons.Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) under President Donald Trump expanded the definition of machine gun to prohibit the production, sale, and possession of bump stocks.In the 1986 firearms act, machine guns are defined as any \"weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\".After the ban was imposed, Texan Michael Cargill challenged the ATF's rule.A federal appeals court reversed an earlier decision that \"bump stocks qualify as machine guns under the best interpretation\", saying it was too broad.Now the conservative-majority Supreme Court will have the final word. Its ruling is expected in June.If it sides with the Texas Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, it would invalidate the ATF's rule and any states that do not have their own laws in place restricting bump stocks would automatically see bump stocks legalised again.",
        "A movie set weapons handler who loaded a gun for actor Alec Baldwin before it fired and killed a cinematographer has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was found not guilty of a second charge - tampering with evidence over the 2021 shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.The 26-year-old faces up to 18 months in jail. She will be sentenced later.Mr Baldwin, 65, also faces a manslaughter trial in July.Ms Hutchins, 42, was killed after a gun Mr Baldwin used in a rehearsal fired a live round on the set of the Western in New Mexico.A lawyer for Mr Baldwin said Gutierrez-Reed's sentencing was \"very positive\" for her client's upcoming case.He could not have foreseen that there was a live round on set because the \"safety, maintenance and care of the firearm and the ammunition\" was the responsibility of the armourer, Misty Marris told CNN.Jurors deliberated for three hours before returning Wednesday's verdict.Gutierrez-Reed remained expressionless as she learned her fate.As she was led away by two officers she told her weeping mother, \"It'll be OK,\" according to Reuters.Ms Hutchins' parents and her sister said they were \"satisfied\" with the verdict.Their statement added: \"We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna's death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions.\"\"It means that someone has been held legally criminally culpable for the death of Halyna Hutchins,\" Misty Marris told CNN.She said Mr Baldwin would argue that \"it was not foreseeable that there was a real bullet in that gun\".Prosecutors said Gutierrez-Reed had failed to ensure the weapon was only loaded with dummy rounds - fake bullets used to look and sound like real ones.\"This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being,\" prosecutor Kari T Morrissey said during closing arguments on Wednesday.Gutierrez-Reed was \"negligent\", \"careless\" and \"thoughtless\" when she failed to notice that live bullets had mixed with dummy rounds in a box of ammunition on set, Ms Morrissey told the jurors.One of those bullets was in the firearm that was used by Mr Baldwin, prosecutors said.Prosecutors also presented evidence that Gutierrez-Reed had brought a box of live bullets to the New Mexico film set from her California home. They said these live rounds slowly spread throughout the set over the course of 12 days.Ms Morrissey said she believed the armourer did not intend to bring live rounds to the set, but rather that Ms Hutchins' death was a case of tragic negligence.The prosecutor added that Gutierrez-Reed was more \"worried about her career\" and less about the victims in the aftermath of the shooting.Gutierrez-Reed did not testify in the two-week trial, but her lawyer said in closing arguments that prosecutors had failed to prove his client was the sole person responsible for the fatal shooting.\"The [ammunition] boxes don't matter, because we don't know what was in them three or four days before,\" her lawyer, Jason Bowles told the jury, arguing his client did not know that there were real bullets on set.Mr Bowles also blamed Mr Baldwin, arguing that he had \"gone off-script\" when he pointed the gun at film crew.\"It was not in the script for Mr Baldwin to point the weapon,\" he said. \"She didn't know that Mr Baldwin was going to do what he did.\"He vowed to file an appeal.Trial witnesses included the film's director, Joel Souza, who was also shot in the incident but survived.Mr Souza said he remembered looking up at Gutierrez-Reed after he was shot, and hearing her repeatedly say: \"I'm sorry, Joel.\"The jury was also shown emotional and distressing footage of the aftermath of the shooting, when the Colt .45 revolver held by Mr Baldwin went off.It included a video that appeared to show Ms Hutchins' final moments, with paramedics frantically trying to save her life.Gutierrez-Reed was also found not guilty of evidence tampering stemming from accusations that she attempted to dispose of a small bag of narcotics after the shooting.Last year, the movie's cast and crew finished filming in tribute to Ms Hutchins, with her husband serving as an executive producer.",
        "Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died on the set of Western film Rust in New Mexico in 2021, after a gun held by Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin fired a live round while he was rehearsing a scene.He has denied pulling the trigger and has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He is expected to go on trial in July.The film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for the weapons on the set, has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.Here is a summary of the events so far.Halyna Hutchins dies and director Joel Souza is injured after Alec Baldwin fires a prop gun on a film set for 19th Century western Rust in New Mexico.Ukrainian-born Hutchins was shot while working as the film's director of photography. The 42-year-old was flown to hospital by helicopter, but died of her injuries. Souza was taken by ambulance from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch.Baldwin, who is also a co-producer of Rust, plays the film's lead and namesake - an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter. The actor, 64, is best-known as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live.Speaking at the time, he said: \"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.\" He said he was \"fully co-operating with the police investigation\".In his first statement since the on-set shooting, injured director Souza says he is \"gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague\" Hutchins.Hutchins was fatally shot in the chest. Souza, who had been standing behind her, was treated in hospital for a wound to the shoulder, and later discharged.Court submissions show assistant director David Halls did not know the gun contained live ammunition, and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun!\"A vigil takes place in New Mexico to mourn Hutchins, with industry professionals among those lighting candles in her memory.Legal documents reveal Alec Baldwin was drawing a revolver across his body and pointing it at a camera during the on-set rehearsal when the gun fired.It is revealed Rust's assistant director, David Halls, had been sacked from a previous production, war drama Freedom's Path, over gun safety violations in 2019.A statement from the producers of that film told news agency AFP that Halls was dismissed after a crew member \"incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged\".Halls could not be reached for comment. There is no suggestion that he was at fault for the Rust incident.Criminal charges may still be filed over the shooting on the set of Rust, police say, a week after the tragedy.Investigators said a \"lead projectile\" had been removed from director Souza's shoulder, and that it appeared to be a live round.Sante Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said police had recovered 600 pieces of evidence so far - including three firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition.Baldwin speaks publicly for the first time since the shooting, calling Hutchins \"my friend\".\"The day I arrived in Santa Fe and started shooting I took her [Hutchins] to dinner with Joel,\" he said. \"We were a very, very well-oiled crew shooting a film together, and then this horrible event happened.\"He said police had ordered him not to discuss the ongoing investigation, but described the accident as a \"one-in-a-trillion episode\".He tells reporters he would be in favour of limiting the future use of firearms on film productions to protect people's safety.A legal action against Alec Baldwin alleges that the film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell - who called police after the shooting on the New Mexico film set - filed the case.Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, accused the actor of \"playing Russian roulette\" when he fired the gun without checking it first.Police obtain a further warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier.An affidavit - a written statement of evidence - with the warrant says police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop.The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round may have been from some \"reloaded ammunition\".He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit.Baldwin admits his acting career may be over, telling George Stephanopoulos of ABC News: \"It could be\", adding that he did not care.He also says he \"didn't pull the trigger\" of the gun during the incident, and adds: \"Someone put a live bullet in a gun. I know it's not me.\"Baldwin said that, while he didn't feel guilty, the incident had left him emotionally scarred.According to court records, Halls was given the gun by Gutierrez-Reed. Her lawyers have said she did not know where \"the live rounds came from\". That question lies at the centre of the police investigation.Police obtain a search warrant for Baldwin's phone, issued by a Sante Fe court. The warrant claims \"there may be evidence on the phone\" that could be \"material and relevant to this investigation\".Investigators move to confiscate Baldwin's iPhone to look at text messages, emails, web browser history and other information.Despite obtaining a search warrant more than three weeks earlier, in December, officials say they have been unable to obtain Baldwin's phone.The actor hits back at suggestions he is not complying with the investigation.In a long video message posted to his Instagram page, the actor says \"any suggestion\" he had been deliberately evasive with investigators was a \"lie\".\"They can't just go through your phone and take your photos, or your love letters to your wife, or what have you,\" Mr Baldwin said. \"That is a process that takes time. But of course we are going to comply 1000% with all that.\"Gutierrez-Reed sues the prop supplier, alleging his company distributed \"a mix of dummy and live ammunition\" on set.She filed her legal claim in New Mexico state court, and is seeking unspecified damages from Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. Kenney has not yet commented.Her claim states: \"The ammunition was misrepresented as only dummy ammunition when it contained both dummy and live ammunition.\"But in December, Kenney had told Good Morning America: \"It's not possible that they [the live rounds] came from PDQ or myself personally.\"Court documents state Gutierrez-Reed said police discovered seven bullets suspected of being live after the shooting, according to AFP news agency.The documents said the bullets were distributed among a box of cartridges with other ammunition and cartridge belts, intended for the actors to use as accessories.Baldwin turns over his mobile phone to police investigating the fatal shooting.Hutchins' family brings a lawsuit against Baldwin, assistant director Halls, armourer Gutierrez-Reed and prop master Sarah Zachry.It alleges Baldwin \"recklessly shot and killed\" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in October 2021.Lawyers for the Hutchins' family say she would still be alive if crew members had not cut corners.The case was filed in the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico on behalf of the cinematographer's husband, Matthew, and son Andros, and seeks unspecified damages.Hutchins' husband says it is \"absurd\" that Baldwin is not taking responsibility for her death.Matthew Hutchins tells NBC's Today: \"I was angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way, and then to not accept responsibility after having just described killing her.\"The producers of Rust are fined and strongly criticised by authorities for failing to follow safety guidelines.The makers of the film showed \"plain indifference to recognised hazards associated with use of firearms on set\", according to the New Mexico Environment Department.The agency issues the maximum $136,793 (\u00a3105,000) fine to Rust Movie Productions.Police release footage from the set of Rust, including of the aftermath of the fatal shooting.Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza also releases crime scene photos and witness interviews with people including Baldwin.The producers of Rust dispute an official report saying they were indifferent to gun safety before the on-set shooting tragedy.Rust Movie Productions says it \"enforced all applicable safety protocols\".In legal documents filed to contest the official findings, the firm also said it \"did not 'wilfully' violate any safety protocol\".Baldwin reaches a settlement with Hutchins' family.Filming of Rust will continue in January 2023, with her widower Matthew on board as the movie's executive producer.All parties believe Hutchins' death was an accident, her husband said.The exact terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, are not disclosed.Heather Brewer, spokesperson for the office of the first judicial district attorney for New Mexico, said the proposed settlement \"will have no impact on District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altweis' ongoing investigation, or her ultimate decision whether to file criminal charges in the case\".Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will each will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting of Halyna Hutchins, District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announces.Lawyers for both say they intend to fight the charges in court.Both face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (\u00a34,040) fine if convicted. They will be tried by a jury, prosecutors say.Assistant director David Halls entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation.Baldwin was on the phone during firearms training for Rust, prosecutors say, as they charge him with involuntary manslaughter.Santa Fe's District Attorney's Office accuse the actor of \"many instances of extremely reckless acts\".\"If Mr Baldwin had performed mandatory safety checks with armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and not pointed the gun at Hutchins, the \"tragedy would not have occurred\", wrote Robert Shilling. He is a special investigator for the district attorney's office, and wrote this in a statement of probable cause filed with the manslaughter charges.Baldwin has previously denied responsibility for the shooting and a representative declined to comment to the BBC.A lawyer for Gutierrez-Reed says she \"will fight these charges\" and blamed Halls for not letting her know that a real gun was to be used in the moment when the fatal shooting occurred.Hutchins' family files a new civil suit against Alec Baldwin and producers involved in Rust.Their lawyer, Gloria Allred, says they were \"devastated by the shocking killing\" and \"feel strongly that anyone who is responsible for her loss must be held accountable\".The case alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, and is being brought in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Hutchins' mother, father and sister, who are living in Ukraine.Filming on Rust is to resume this spring, according to US reports, with Baldwin remaining in the the starring role. It is shifting location to Montana.A mix of new and old crew members will work on the film, with Bianca Cline taking over as cinematographer.Meanwhile Hutchins' widower Matthew has also approved a documentary about his late wife, producers said.The documentary, made \"at [executive producer, Mr] Hutchins' behest, and with his blessing and support\" will explore Ms Hutchins' life and \"final work, including the completion of the film\", a statement said.Rust Movie productions, which Baldwin is part of, have said that the scene which was being rehearsed when Ms Hutchins was shot has now been rewritten, and that the \"any use of working weapons and any form of ammunition\" had been barred from the set.Prosecutors in New Mexico drop firearm enhancement charges against Baldwin, in a move which reduces possible prison time for the actor, as the charges carry a mandatory five-year prison sentence.He still faces up to 18 months in prison under involuntary manslaughter charges.Heather Brewer, Santa Fe county district attorney spokesperson, said the prosecution dropped the firearm enhancement charge to \"avoid further litigious distractions by Mr Baldwin and his attorneys\".According to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, prosecutors also dropped the firearm enhancement charge for Gutierrez-Reed.Lawyers for Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed had been arguing against the firearm enhancement charge, saying prosecutors were applying a version of the law passed after the October 2021 shooting accident.Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.He entered his plea online and also waived his right to an upcoming virtual court hearing.Gutierrez-Reed is also accused of involuntary manslaughter; prosecutors say she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the gun that killed Hutchins.Criminal charges are dropped against Alec Baldwin over the fatal on-set shooting.A statement, released by New Mexico special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis, said that \"over the last few days... new facts were revealed\" in the case, requiring further investigation.\"This decision does not absolve Mr Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\" the statement continued, adding: \"Our follow-up investigation will remain active and ongoing.\"A lawyer for Mr Baldwin praised the move by prosecutors, saying: \"We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.\"The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is still facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter, and there will be a preliminary hearing on 3 May.On the same day, filming and principal photography for Rust resumed in Montana.The family of Halyna Hutchins said they will sue Alec Baldwin despite his criminal charges being dropped.A lawyer for Ms Hutchins' parents and sister said that the actor \"cannot escape responsibility\" for her death.Mr Baldwin had already reached a deal with her widower and 10-year-old son.A judge approved a settlement agreement for the family of Halyna Hutchins.Lawyers representing Ms Hutchins' husband Matthew and their son Andros sued Baldwin and the film's other producers for wrongful death in 2022.An undisclosed settlement was agreed later the same year.On Thursday, US judge Bryan Biedscheid approved that agreement, which will see youngster Andros receive \"periodic payments\" when he reaches the ages of 18 and 22.The order stated that the settlement was \"fair, appropriate, and in the best interests of Andros Hutchins, a minor, protected person\".Matthew Hutchins, as part of the settlement, will also become an executive producer on Rust - the western film which recently resumed filming in Montana.A weapons supervisor on the set of Alec Baldwin's film Rust was likely hungover on the day a cinematographer was fatally shot, prosecutors alleged.They accused Hannah Gutierrez-Reed of drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in the evenings during filming.In response, her lawyer said prosecutors had mishandled the case and resorted to \"character assassination\".Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armourer and weapons supervisor on Rust pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering charges.Prosecutors say Ms Gutierrez-Reed acted recklessly when loading the gun.They said she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the weapon that killed Ms Hutchins, and that the armourer handed the gun to Baldwin, having not checked that all the bullets were dummies.Ms Gutierrez-Reed denies this.A new report appeared to cast doubt over Mr Baldwin's accounts of events.He repeatedly denied pulling the trigger of the prop gun which went off, killing Ms Hutchins.But weapons experts said the trigger would have \"had to be pulled\".A grand jury in New Mexico charged Alec Baldwin with a fresh count of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting.Local prosecutors shared \"additional facts\" from forensic tests on the weapon used in the shooting.The actor's lawyers told the BBC: \"We look forward to our day in court.\"Alec Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.He has maintained he did not pull the trigger of the Colt .45 pistol and only drew back its hammer.Ms Gutierrez-Reed went on trial, pleading not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence.Ms Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter but not guilty of evidence tampering.In closing arguments, prosecutors told jurors that she had failed to ensure the weapon was only loaded with dummy rounds - fake bullets used to look and sound like real ones.Ms Gutierrez-Reed did not testify, but her lawyer said prosecutors had failed to prove his client was the sole person responsible for the fatal shooting.",
        "Alabama lawmakers have passed a bill to protect in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) clinics and doctors from lawsuits and criminal prosecution.The state's supreme court last month ruled that frozen embryos had the same rights as children, and people could be held liable for destroying them.At least three IVF clinics paused treatments after the ruling, causing political fallout for Republicans.The new law will allow the clinics to resume services.The Alabama bill had overwhelming bipartisan support on Wednesday. It passed by a vote of 81-12 in the state's House and 29-1 in the Senate.Governor Kay Ivey, a Republican, quickly signed it into law.The measures are designed to shield IVF providers from legal action and prosecution for \"damage or death of an embryo\" during services.Proponents of the bill said they hoped this would allow IVF providers to re-start services.\"The problem we are trying to solve right now is to get those families back on track to be moving forward as they try to have children,\" state legislator Terri Collins told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.While the measure offers limited legal immunity to medical providers, it still allows - in some cases - for lawsuits to be filed against manufacturers of IVF equipment if they damage or destroy an embryo during the treatment process.The bill also did not weigh in on whether embryos can be legally classified as children.Alabama Democratic House minority leader Anthony Daniels told AL.com earlier on Wednesday that the measure did not sufficiently answer the question of whether embryos outside the womb are children.\"Until that issue is addressed, it's just putting a Band-Aid over something that requires stitches and surgery,\" Mr Daniels said.The 16 February decision from the Supreme Court of Alabama stemmed from wrongful death lawsuits filed on behalf of three couples whose frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed at a clinic in 2020.The ruling sparked an immediate backlash, both in the southern state and nationally.With eight months to go until the US presidential election, President Joe Biden's campaign has seized on the controversy.A Pew survey released last year found that 42% of Americans have either used IVF treatments or know someone who did.That percentage rises to 45% among middle-income Americans and 59% for those with high-incomes.",
        "The US House of Representatives has voted to approve a $467.5bn (\u00a3367bn) spending package, the first step in averting a partial government shutdown.Funding for roughly 30% of the federal government - including agriculture, energy, housing and veterans' affairs - is due to expire at midnight on Friday.The House-passed bill now goes to the US Senate, where leaders have vowed to back the measure \"with time to spare\".But the threat of shutdown looms over Congress once again in just two weeks.On Wednesday, House lawmakers voted 339-85 on the sprawling package of six funding bills, a compromise jointly agreed between House and Senate leaders after months of negotiation.Once it passes the Senate and is signed by President Joe Biden, the 1,050-page piece of legislation would extend the funding available for dozens of federal programmes from 8 March until 30 September.Negotiators, however, have much left to agree on before another funding deadline - on 22 March - for major government agencies such as the defence, homeland security and state departments.Capitol Hill has been embroiled in bitter spending fights for the past six months between Republicans, who run the House, and Democrats, who lead in the Senate.House Speaker Mike Johnson has had his work cut out for him by an increasingly narrow Republican majority and, more recently, by conservative rebels.With the country $34.4tn in debt, the right-wing House Freedom Caucus has demanded spending cuts that often go much deeper than what their Democratic colleagues would accept.But Mr Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that Republicans \"have to be realistic about what we're able to achieve\" with their wafer-thin majority.As has become the case with recent spending measures, he had to turn to Democrats for the votes needed to pass the bill.It is a move that contributed to the dramatic ousting of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, last year.As many as 83 Republicans voted against the bill on Wednesday, with the Freedom Caucus issuing a statement that it \"punts on nearly every single Republican policy priority\", including immigration.\"Republicans will go around and talk about how they scored major wins, how they somehow delivered for the American people,\" Texas congressman Chip Roy said on the House floor. \"The fact of the matter is we did no such thing.\"While the Speaker touted 6% of spending cuts to the FBI, a 10% cut to the Environmental Protection Agency and a 7% cut to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, it was the Democrats who celebrated the final product.Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut told reporters her party had managed to prevent cuts to food and nutrition programmes. They also defeated a Republican effort to defund expanded access to abortion pills.\"This legislation does not have everything either side may have wanted, but I am pleased that many of the extreme cuts and policies proposed by House Republicans were excluded,\" she said.By Wednesday night, the Senate had begun deliberating over the bill and was expected to approve it without significant opposition.The breakthrough comes at an opportune time for President Biden, who will deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Thursday.",
        "Nikki Haley is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race after winning just two Republican primaries.\"The time has now come to suspend my campaign,\" she said at a news conference on Wednesday morning.Her departure will leave her rival Donald Trump as the only Republican left after he dominated Super Tuesday, racking up a series of wins.Ms Haley did not endorse Mr Trump during her exit speech.Instead, she congratulated him and said she \"wish[ed] him well\".She said it is now up to Mr Trump \"to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him\".Though Ms Haley came nowhere near to securing the party's nomination, she found substantial support among voters who had rejected the former president, and in particular college-educated voters.The question now will be whether her supporters, who made up a quarter of Republican primary voters in some states, will back Mr Trump.On his social media site Truth Social, Mr Trump said Ms Haley had been \"trounced last night, in record setting fashion\".Ms Haley had pitched herself as a fresh start for the party and the chance to move past Mr Trump. But she only won Vermont and the District of Columbia in the primaries.The former president even beat her in South Carolina where she was a popular governor.Ms Haley said on Wednesday she stayed in the race because she had \"wanted Americans to have their voices heard\" and \"I have done that\".\"I have no regrets,\" she said.During her brief speech, the former United Nations ambassador emphasised the policy issues of her campaign stops, including the economy, the threat of socialism, and international conflict.\"Our national debt will eventually crush our economy,\" she said. \"Our world is on fire because of America's retreat. Standing by our allies in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan is a moral imperative.\"On Super Tuesday Mr Trump swept Ms Haley by double-digit margins in several states, including Texas and California, the two states offering the largest number of delegates.Her departure puts Mr Trump on a clear path to win the Republican nomination this month unchallenged and a rematch with Joe Biden in November.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who had yet to endorse a candidate - quickly announced his support for Mr Trump after Ms Haley's announcement. The two have sparred in the past, but Mr McConnell said it was \"abundantly clear\" Mr Trump had earned the support of the party.Some criticised Ms Haley for declining to endorse Mr Trump, including Penny Nance, the leader of the conservative Concerned Women for America group. She argued Mr Trump was the best chance to defeat Democrats.\"If [Haley] is not on board with that, her motives are clear and conservatives will never forgive or forget,\" she said.Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, meanwhile, commended Ms Haley for a \"hard-fought campaign\".Mr Biden was quick to try to woo the former South Carolina governor's supporters after her announcement.\"It takes a lot of courage to run for President - that's especially true in today's Republican Party, where so few dare to speak the truth about Donald Trump,\" he said of Ms Haley. \"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign.\"Mitch Landrieu, a national co-chair of the president's re-election campaign, told CNN that Mr Biden had personally contacted Ms Haley on Wednesday.\"There are a lot of the things that the folks that voted for Nikki Haley share with Joe Biden,\" he said.In a statement on Tuesday night, prior to Ms Haley ending her run, her campaign said it was \"honoured\" she had become the first Republican woman to win two presidential primary contests.\"There remains a large bloc of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump.\"That is not the unity our party needs for success. Addressing those voters' concerns will make the Republican Party and America better.\"Ms Haley has also not yet spoken about her plans for after the primary race.During her speech on Wednesday, Ms Haley said she was looking forward to life as a \"private citizen\".\"Although I am no longer a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in,\" she said.Ms Haley had presented herself as a chance for the country to move on from the \"chaos\" of her former boss, who made her ambassador to the UN.In the final weeks of her campaign she levelled increasingly forceful attacks at Mr Trump, taking aim at his age and mental acuity, and criticising him for \"buddying up\" to dictators like Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong-un.",
        "Donald Trump has challenged Joe Biden to TV debates, as the rivals hurtle towards a White House rematch following their sweep of the Super Tuesday votes.The Republican said he would take part in a TV forum with the Democratic president \"anytime, anywhere, anyplace\" posting online in all capital letters.Mr Biden's campaign said Mr Trump was \"thirsty for attention and struggling to expand his appeal\".No debates have so far been agreed ahead of November's election.Mr Trump's challenge came hours after his last Republican rival, Nikki Haley, dropped out of the race to be the Republican nominee for the White House.\"It is important, for the Good of our Country, that Joe Biden and I Debate Issues that are so vital to America, and the American People,\" Mr Trump posted on his social media website, Truth Social, hours after Ms Haley's departure from the race.He added that such debates could be run by the Democratic National Committee, or the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen presidential debates for the last 30 years.Mr Trump said the debate commission - which declares itself non-partisan, but is accused by conservatives of bias - was a \"subsidiary\" of the Democratic party.Mr Trump, 77, has repeatedly claimed Mr Biden, 81, is too old and forgetful to debate him. Mr Biden has in turn suggested it is Mr Trump who is senile.The White House press secretary was asked earlier on Wednesday whether refusing a debate could cast doubt on Mr Biden's \"acuity\". She suggested the reporter speak to the president's re-election campaign.The Biden campaign did not say whether he would participate in a debate against Mr Trump, and instead suggested that the Republican tune in to the president's Thursday evening State of the Union address to Congress.\"That's a conversation we'll have at the appropriate time in this cycle,\" said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.\"If he's so desperate to see President Biden in primetime, he doesn't have to wait! He can join the tens of millions of Americans who will tune in to watch the State of the Union tomorrow night,\" he continued.On Wednesday, Mr Trump also said that he would watch the State of the Union and \"will correct, in rapid response\" Mr Biden's speech.Mr Trump was fiercely criticised after he refused to take part in TV debates with his Republican rivals for the party's White House nomination this election cycle.He argued at the time that he had nothing to gain from such forums, citing his wide lead in the polls.Mr Biden and Mr Trump debated each other twice during the 2020 election.",
        "\"Oompa-loompa, doompity-dee, now the best director categor-ee. Oompa Loompa doompity-dong, most of these films were frankly too long.\"Fresh from starring in Wonka, Hugh Grant's (life-size) onstage appearance at the Baftas not only saw him revive his inner Oompa Loompa when delivering the award for best director, but also openly question the length of this year's awards season contenders.He may have been thinking of the evening's eventual winner, Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic Oppenheimer, which is also expected to sweep the Oscars this weekend.But three of the five other Bafta nominees - The Holdovers, Maestro, and Anatomy of a Fall - likewise Oscar contenders, also clock in at over two hours each.Good thing, perhaps, that Grant didn't have to confront Martin Scorsese's American introspective, Killers of the Flower Moon, an Academy favourite despite its 3hr 26min runtime - the longest of this year's best picture contenders.But are this year's nominated films part of a (growing) trend? If so, what does this mean for audiences, cinemas and directors?A rainy afternoon trip to the cinema may have reliably lured families, couples and single souls for decades, but film durations have fluctuated throughout this time.The sense of screenings themselves becoming an all-day event can first be traced back to the 1960s, as directors revelled in a golden age for the silver screen.Lawrence of Arabia ran beyond three-and-a-half hours in 1962. Cleopatra, released a year later, originally stretched to four before being cut down.Intermissions were central to this experience as projectionists transferred over physical reels, giving audiences a natural rest break for the loo and the chance to buy ice cream.But advancements in projector technology meant intermissions were no longer needed, and this staple of movie-going was phased out, with 1982's Gandhi thought to be the last major western feature to include an intermission as standard.In the intervening decades, film lengths have steadily increased, quite literally keeping audiences in their seats.Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, told the BBC its members are engaged in \"ongoing discussions\" with studios, distributors and others relevant parties about potentially reintroducing \"structured intermissions\", possibly for films lasting three hours or more.An analysis by The Economist of over 100,000 feature films released internationally since the 1930s found current popular movie runtimes to be the highest on record.And there's been a significant spike in recent years. Statista research across the decades reveals that, on average, the highest-grossing movies in the US and Canada have grown by around 30 minutes since 2020 alone, hitting 2hrs 23mins by 2023.It's not only franchise blockbusters that are responsible (yes, Indiana Jones, John Wick and Avengers: Endgame, we're looking at you), but Oscar nominated films.Avatar: The Way of Water, 2023's longest best picture nominee also hit the three-hour mark.\"We've seen epic filmmaking do well at the Oscars in every decade,\" says Karie Bible, box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. \"The very first film to win best picture in 1927 was an aviation epic called Wings that ran for two hours and 24 minutes.\"\"Epic films often mean epic storytelling,\" she explains. \"These films are larger than life and often encompass a long, developed story that ask people to be emotionally invested.\"But this artistic rationale is being pushed to its limits - with audience bladders left bursting as directors are empowered like never before.The Cold War between streaming and cinema over the past decade has made the name behind the camera almost as coveted as any A-list actor.As streaming services vie with Hollywood for credibility and prestige they've thrown huge amounts of money at directing talent - often far outmatching anything a legacy studio can offer - with success.Before Scorsese partnered with Apple for Killers of the Flower Moon, he turned to Netflix to fund his Oscar nominated three-and-a-half-hour mob movie The Irishman, telling the BBC he \"couldn't get financing\" from Hollywood to match his ambition.The template has similarly tempted David Fincher, Rian Johnson and latterly Ridley Scott - who has hinted at releasing a four-hour cut of Napoleon on Apple TV, despite his original version already being nearly three hours.The dynamic can weaken producer control and inflate runtimes. In his podcast review for Killers of the Flower Moon, Mark Kermode explained: \"We hear stories about... people making films for studios for theatrical exhibition, then you end up having fights with the producers about [length]. If you're a streaming service, they don't care.\"This challenge comes at a hefty price for traditional film studios, at a time when tinseltown is having to find a delicate balance between squeezed costs - exacerbated by the pandemic - last year's strikes and the challenge of tempting people away from lockdown-inspired home streaming.\"Casual moviegoing, where you wait until the weekend to pick what to see, has pretty much been supplanted by streaming,\" Erin Brockovich producer Michael Shamberg told Vanity Fair's Natalie Jarvey for her aptly named article: Why Are Movies Sooooo Long?\"Now when you leave your house to pay to see a movie, you want an emotional sure thing for your time and effort. You also want a bigger experience than streaming a movie in your living room,\" he added.The knock-on effect of \"event\" cinema, increasingly tied to social media buzz, sees the industry - and cinemas themselves - reliant on goldrush titles, be it Top Gun: Maverick post-lockdown or Oppenheimer last year, to mask over the cracks of reduced pulling power.And even taking Nolan's popularity as a director into account, the mainstream success of Oppenheimer, on paper, a three-hour historical biopic, benefitted hugely from the Barbenheimer phenomenon: an accidental marketing dream.Outside that near one-off event, the overwhelming temptation to \"go long\" seems to be partially wearing thin, with cinemas, audiences and directors.Cinema chains, says Clapp, can struggle with a flurry of longer films, as this \"means less screenings\", choice and ultimately tickets sold - only a fraction of which can be made up by popcorn and fizzy drinks, or luxury seating.\"We would never want to dictate creative licence, but there's a desire amongst a proportion of the audience for a break,\" he says, pointing to the potential for intermissions, and their confectionary window.Cinema chain Vue was among a handful worldwide to forgo distribution agreements and trial intervals during Killers of the Flower Moon.\"Analysis showed customers would like to see the return of intermissions,\" Vue's chief executive, Tim Richards, told The Guardian last October. \"We've seen 74% positive feedback from those who have tried our interval.\"Clapp describes it as a \"live debate\" especially with intermissions remaining in other global markets.\"The concern is that wherever you drop the curtain, so to speak, you'll kill the narrative structure, but this doesn't need to be the case with careful planning - arguably people getting up midway through a film causes more disruption,\" he says.Scorsese, for his part, urged viewers to show \"commitment\" to cinema, lambasting complaints in light of TV binge-watching at home.\"You can sit in front of the TV and watch something for five hours\u2026 there are many people who watch theatre for 3.5 hours \u2026 give cinema some respect,\" he told Hindustan Times.But not every director agrees. As Holdovers' mastermind Alexander Payne bemoaned: \"There are too many damn long movies these days.\" Lengthy runtimes, he added, should always be \"the shortest possible version\".For Nolan, the relationship with the audience remains foremost in his mind: \"I view myself as the audience. I make the films that I would really... want to watch,\" he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall.For younger audiences however, frequently cast as rejecting long-form viewing in the age of TikTok and YouTube shorts, Nolan's epics - often near three hours - should not appeal.But Dune director Denis Villeneuve says Oppenheimer's success proves the opposite. He argues younger audiences value watching and paying for longer films, provided they offer \"something substantial\". \"They are craving meaningful content,\" he told The Times.Dune: Part Two, released last week, outlasts the original film's 155-minute runtime by ten minutes, providing five hours of desert adventure in total.One nationwide chain, Showcase Cinemas, offered both instalments back-to-back across the opening night.Hopefully there was an intermission.",
        "A patient who was left in a hospital chair for five days has said conditions there have been likened to a warzone.Nicky Roberts, 42, went to Morriston Hospital, Swansea, on Saturday night with severe headaches and was told he had a potentially serious condition.But he said he was told there were no beds and has slept on a chair in a room next to A&E since being admitted.Swansea Bay health board apologised and said with \"exceptional demand, waits are much longer than we would like\".Mr Roberts, from Swansea, said he was told he would have to stay in hospital as he had hypercalcaemia - a condition where the calcium levels in the blood are too high - which can be life-threatening in some cases.\"When I came in on Saturday night I was told the wait was 13 hours but because I was quite unwell I got seen in about three hours,\" he said.\"It was OK for the first six to eight hours, but by Sunday it was quite clear there was no plan about how they were going to see all these patients.\"\"It is just like a third world or war hospital in... a pavilion or tent,\" he said.Mr Roberts said there were people with \"bloody injuries\" and other patients who were \"unwell with heart problems\" also left to sleep in chairs or on the floor.\"There are people waiting for ward space, but there isn't any,\" he added.He said: \"Over the last few days I've heard people describing it as being in a warzone here, with people on the floor, people needing treatment and not getting it.\"At one point there was about one nurse looking after about 20 patients.\"The staff are doing their best but they're so far stretched. If you push people that far it's inevitable people are going to make mistakes.\"It's been really horrible to see and experience the situation the NHS is faced with.\"Mr Roberts, an IT service manager, said he had not been told what his treatment plan was, and was worried about how long he would have to stay in hospital.Speaking on Wednesday, he said: \"They haven't had enough time to explain what's wrong with me, or with anyone else here.\"I'm just overthinking what's wrong with me, am I going to be OK? When will I be able to go home?\"On Sunday I was told they would start the treatment but it still hasn't started.\"Mr Roberts said he slept on the same chair from Saturday to Tuesday, and was moved to another \"slightly comfier\" chair on Tuesday night.\"I think I had about 30 minutes sleep during the first four days. It's been a nightmare.\"In a statement on social media on Wednesday, the health board said Morriston Hospital was \"under extreme pressure with high numbers of acutely unwell patients needing treatment and beds\".It said: \"As a result, we are at our highest level of escalation - a business continuity incident.\"Staff are working extremely hard. But waits are much longer than we would like, especially for those who attend our emergency department with less serious and non-life threatening illnesses or injuries.\"It said people should not visit the emergency department \"unless absolutely unavoidable\" and those with minor injuries such as broken bones or dislocations should visit the minor injury unit at Neath Port Talbot Hospital.Responding to Mr Roberts' experience, the health board said it was \"very sorry\".A spokesperson added: \"We do not want anyone waiting a long time for a bed.\"Here at Morriston Hospital we have undertaken a significant amount of work around our front door, which is designed to offer the right care to the right patient in the right setting, enabling those who can do so safely to go home sooner and, for those who need one, to be admitted to a bed as soon as possible.\"But we are currently experiencing exceptional demand which means that, despite our best efforts, waits are much longer than we would like.\"",
        "Energy prices will fall in April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills.Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support.From April, energy bills will fall by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales.Energy regulator Ofgem recently announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit will pay \u00a31,690 a year.That's a drop of \u00a3238 (or about \u00a320 a month) from the previous energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used.It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.About 5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier, research by Citizens Advice suggests.The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter.Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up.It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024.Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan.If you don't agree one,they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed or switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection.If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future.Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements.These were brought in after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.The rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\".Meters cannot be fitted for:About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem.Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same.If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier.You can ask for a review of your payments and debt repayments, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay and access to hardship funds.If eligible, you could be added a list of households entitled to extra support, the Priority Services Register.It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account.Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons.Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check the MoneyHelper benefits guide or use the Entitledto and Turn2us benefits calculators.Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can get help with energy bills.Councils can offer help through the Household Support Fund, which has been extended for six months from March 2024.Finally, adjusting settings on your boiler can save money.",
        "Nationwide Building Society has reached an agreement to buy Virgin Money in a \u00a32.9bn deal which would see the brand eventually disappear.The deal would create the UK's second largest mortgage and savings group.Nationwide said it would not make any material changes to Virgin Money's 7,300 employees \"in the near term\".It said that it would keep using the Virgin Money brand initially but it would be phased out over six years once the proposed takeover is completed.If the deal goes ahead it would be the biggest UK bank takeover since the 2008 financial crisis. It led to the nationalisation of Northern Rock bank, which was then bought by Virgin Money in 2012.Virgin Money was then bought by the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank group CYBG in 2018, but the group was rebranded under the Virgin name.Virgin Money is now the UK's sixth largest retail bank with around 6.6 million customers, while Nationwide is UK's biggest building society with more than 17 million customers.Combining the two would create a group with 696 branches.In the UK, only Lloyds Banking Group would be bigger.Nationwide said it would keep a branch in each location where the two businesses are present until at least the start of 2026.Nationwide will stay a mutual, and wants to gradually integrate Virgin Money.In the medium term, Virgin Money would operate as a separate legal entity with its own board and banking licence.The 220p-a-share price offered by Nationwide is 38% higher than Virgin Money's closing share price on Wednesday, and the bank says it is \"minded to recommend it\" to shareholders.The deal does not need the approval of Nationwide's mutual members but it does need to be backed by Virgin shareholders.Last month, Barclays announced it was buying Tesco's retail banking operations for \u00a3600m, and analysts say the sector could see more takeovers.\"With the outlook for the UK economy stabilising, we wouldn't be surprised to see more deals like this announced,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Benjamin Toms told Reuters.\"UK bank valuations are relatively cheap for the sustainable returns they offer.\"",
        "BBC Scotland presenter Nick Sheridan has died after a short illness.His death at the age of 32 was announced by the broadcaster in a post on X on Thursday morning.He had presented programmes including Reporting Scotland, Drivetime, the Nine and Seven Days since joining BBC Scotland in 2018.Head of news Gary Smith said Nick had been a \"wonderful colleague to those of us who have worked with him since he joined BBC Scotland in 2018\".He added: \"He was a hugely talented journalist, presenter and author - and one of those rare people who light up the lives of everyone around them. Funny, clever, kind. A lovely man.\"Our hearts go out to his parents, who have been with him over the past ten days, to his partner, Lewis, and to all the rest of his family and friends.\"First Minister Humza Yousaf paid tribute to Sheridan as he started his weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament chamber, describing him as an \"extremely talented journalist and author\".Mr Yousaf added: \"He will be greatly missed. Many of us in this chamber will have been questioned by Nick - quite robustly no doubt - whether it was on BBC Drivetime or on many of the other programmes that he presented.\"My thoughts are with his family, his many friends and indeed his colleagues.

        "Dad-of-two David Stuart has not been able to claim child benefit for several years.On a salary of \u00a370,000, he was deemed too high an earner.But in Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor raised the income level at which people have to start paying back part of the benefit from \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000, and the level at which it is withdrawn completely from \u00a360,000 to \u00a380,000.It means that David is now eligible for 50% of the benefit, which he says is \"positive\" and he welcomed other proposed changes to the system.The BBC spoke to people with a range of earnings and household set-ups about what they wanted from the Budget and their thoughts on what the chancellor delivered.The accountancy firm EY looked at their circumstances and helped calculate how the Budget would affect their finances.David, 36, from Whitburn. West Lothian, is a data analyst who lives with his wife and two children, aged 10 and six.\"We could claim again and then potentially keep up to 50% of the benefit for the next couple of years, which seems positive,\" he says.Claiming 50% child benefit for two children in 2024-25 would total \u00a31,106.But he has always thought the way the underlying system works is unfair.\"Personally, I'm a high earner - I make higher than the average person in full-time employment. But as a household, I wouldn't say we're high earners.\"While he makes about \u00a370,000 a year, his wife, who works as a childminder, earns around \u00a310,000.Until now, child benefit claims have always been based on an individual's income - whichever parent earns the most. So two parents earning \u00a350,000 each would still be able to claim the full benefit, despite their household earning more than David and his wife.But the chancellor has now announced plans to consult on allowing HMRC to collect household information so that from April 2026 claims would be based on household income - something which David had called for.\"I'm glad they not just raised the threshold, which would have just kicked the can down the road, but it's absolutely the right thing to move towards it being household-assessed,\" he says.\"Obviously it will take time. I understand that.\"But the main thing is it's fairer.\"Joe Makin, 23, earns \u00a322,000 a year working in admin and says almost two-thirds of his take-home pay is eaten up by rent and bills.Joe rents a one-bedroom house in Selby, North Yorkshire. \"Each month I earn about \u00a31,600 after tax. Maybe \u00a31,000-\u00a31,100 of that goes on rent and bills,\" he says.He says he had low expectations ahead of the Budget, so found it \"a smidgen more positive\" than he thought it would be.\"There were some ideas that were quite good. I liked the potential ISA reforms that could help people save money. Better development in the energy grid could bring down energy prices.\"But he says: \"These are small things that scratch the surface of what could be good, but as usual it never tends to go far enough for me. I was waiting for him to say 'and...' but the 'and...' never came.The 2p cut to National Insurance (NI) announced by the chancellor will leave him \u00a3188 a year better off, according to EY.\"For me it's so negligible it's going to make little difference, but it's scalable so for others it's a step in the right direction,\" he says.\"But I don't think [the Budget] goes far enough for people who are worse off than me as the cost-of-living crisis is still very present.\"Aga Szedzianis in Newham, east London says that while there was some good news in the Budget, she would have liked to have seen more help for working parents.With price rises, the cost of childcare, and her mortgage soon set to go up by \u00a3500 a month, things are getting \"quite uncomfortable\".The 37-year-old mum-of-two said the 2p cut to National Insurance was, \"welcome but at the same time if that means spending less on public services then I personally don't think it's worth it\".She would have preferred to have seen income tax thresholds go up.Usually tax thresholds rise in line with inflation, but they have been frozen since 2021. So as your pay goes up, a bigger portion of your income is taxed.Read more on Budget\"I think it would have been better to change them in line with inflation for everyone. [The 40% rate] was supposed to be a high-income tax for the richest.

        "The UK government is to appeal a High Court ruling which found part of its controversial Legacy Act breaches human rights laws.Last month the High Court in Belfast delivered its ruling on a conditional amnesty clause for Troubles-era crimes.This is being challenged by the Northern Ireland Office (NIO).Opponents brought the legal challenge on several grounds, including the immunity aspect, which was passed by Parliament in September.The act involved a conditional amnesty for people suspected of crimes committed during the Troubles and introduces a ban on inquests and future civil actions related to the Troubles.A case against the act was brought forward by relatives of victims and the survivor of a shooting.A government spokesman said: \"We remain committed to implementing the Legacy Act and delivering the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors of the Troubles by giving them more information about what happened to their loved ones.\"Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris had previously said he was committed to implementing the act.He added it was a \"complex case\" that was likely to lead to further action in higher courts.Separately, the Irish government is also taking a case against the UK at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.When the High Court ruled that the Legacy Act breached European Human rights the T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said he was \"not surprised\".He claimed it \"reflects and underpins\" the course of action which the Irish government has taken.The act, which came into effect in September, will end future civil litigation and inquests into deaths which occurred during more than 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.The government has said the legislation, which applies to all former members of the security forces and ex-paramilitaries, is an attempt to draw a line under the events of the past.It has repeatedly stated the new act is, in its view, human rights compliant.Prosecutions that are currently ongoing will continue to conclusion. However inquests will end in May unless they have reached the point of delivering findings.It is also likely to limit investigations, which in future would be undertaken by the ICRIR.A number of legal challenges have been brought by victims' groups and the families of people killed or injured during the Troubles.",
        "The government is cutting National Insurance (NI) by another 2p from April.It is not changing income-tax rates but previous changes to the way tax is calculated mean the amount people pay overall is rising.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the starting rate for NI will change from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers from 6 April 2024.He says this is worth about \u00a3450 a year to an employee on an average salary of \u00a335,000.He is also cutting NI for two million self-employed workers. Their rate will fall from 8% to 6%.The government says that is worth \u00a3350 to a self-employed person earning \u00a328,200.Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270. They previously paid 12%.The government says that when combined with the latest cut, a worker on \u00a335,000 will save \u00a3900 a year.The chancellor had also previously said that from 6 April 2024, two million self-employed people would pay 8% on profits between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270, down from 9%.From the same date, they will no longer pay a separate category of NI called Class 2 contributions.When combined with the cut to 6% announced in the Budget, the government says they will save \u00a3650.The NI rate on income and profits above \u00a350,270 remains at 2%.The government uses National Insurance contributions (NICs) to pay for benefits and help fund the NHS.NI rates apply across the UK. You start paying NI when you turn 16 and earn over \u00a3242 a week, or have profits of more than \u00a312,570 a year.It is not paid by people over state pension age, even if they are working.Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the NI contributions you make across your working life.The government records how many years of contributions you have made. Paying a lower rate of NI does not mean you contribute fewer.If you do not work, for example because you are a carer or claim benefits, you might be able to receive NI credits instead, which mean you will still qualify for the relevant benefits.You can also make voluntary contributions to plug gaps in your record.Despite the NI cuts, millions will still pay more tax overall because of changes to the tax thresholds.These are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates.These used to rise every year in line with inflation.However the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance - the amount you can earn every year before you have to pay income tax - have been frozen at \u00a312,570 until 2028. Higher-rate tax will continue to kick in for earnings above \u00a350,270.Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates.It will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which independently assesses the government's economic plans.According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancels out the benefits of the NI cuts for some workers.In the upcoming financial year, an average earner will have a tax cut of about \u00a3340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between \u00a326,000 and \u00a360,000 will be better off.But by 2027, the average earner would be only \u00a3140 better off - and only people earning between \u00a332,000 and \u00a355,000 a year would be better off.Income tax is paid on earnings from employment and profits from self-employment during the tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions, income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits.The Basic rate is 20% and is paid on annual earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270.The Higher rate is 40%, and is paid on earnings between \u00a350,271 and \u00a3125,140.Once you earn more than \u00a3100,000, you also start losing your tax-free personal allowance.You lose \u00a31 of your personal allowance for every \u00a32 that your income goes above \u00a3100,000.Anyone earning more than \u00a3125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance.The additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above \u00a3125,140 a year.These apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Some income tax rates are different in Scotland.The Scottish Government has already announced that a new 45% band will take effect from April 2024. The top rate will also rise from 47% to 48%.For most families, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay.But for less well-off households, a greater share of family income goes on taxes on spending, known as indirect taxes.For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax paid.You can look at the amount of tax raised as a proportion of the size of the economy, or GDP.In 2022 - the most recent year for which international comparisons can be made - that figure was 35.3%.That puts the UK right in the middle of the G7 group of big economies.France, Italy and Germany tax more; Canada, Japan and the US tax less.However, overall taxation in the UK is high compared with historical rates.In its assessment of the 2024 Budget, the OBR said the government will collect 37.1p of every pound generated in the economy in 2028/29.That will be the highest level in 80 years.Share your reaction to the Budget and any questions you have by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

        "The eviction of an elderly woman with dementia from her Northern Ireland care home was \"traumatic\", her son has said.The man, who the BBC has called Sam, said his mother was told she was no longer a resident after she returned to the home from hospital.On Thursday, the commissioner for older people said some care home residents had faced unfair evictions.Eddie Lynch called for better protection for residents.He also said some had lost their places because their family was seen as \"difficult or undesirable\".A spokeswoman for private care home providers said things \"should not get to the level where people feel that they are being evicted\".Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Sam said his mother, who died last year aged in her 80s, had developed an infection and was taken to hospital for treatment.She was released in the early hours of the morning after being declared \"fit\" but she had no place to go.\"My sister took the precaution to call ahead to the care home because of the early hour and they said my mother was no longer a resident at the care home - the decision was taken and that was that,\" he said.\"We found out she was being evicted at 01:30 in the morning as she stood in her nightdress, her housecoat and her slippers.\"No right to redress and that was the end of it,\" he added.Sam said he felt like the care home had taken an \"easy option\" by evicting his mother.\"The shock was unbelievable - it's a very easy option to say we can't meet your medical needs, unlucky, bye.\"Sam contacted the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland's (COPNI) office for help and he later received an apology from the care home.However, he added: \"It wasn't an apology for evicting my mother - it was an apology for not following their procedures.\"His mother was placed in a different care home where she was \"treated with dignity, respect and compassion\", he continued.A spokeswoman for COPNI encouraged residents and their families to discuss care needs and complaints with their care home providers.In his report, the commissioner said the contract governing the relationship between care homes and health and social care trusts should be changed.Titled Respecting Residents' Rights in Care Homes,\u00a0it found there was a gap in the system which failed to protect care home residents from being involuntarily transferred or \"evicted\" to another care home, for reasons other than a change of care needs.Mr Lynch said: \"A series of complaints from older people, their families and friends led me to track occurrences where the contract's conditions for terminating a residency in a care home were misused.\"On occasion, it is being used as a means of evicting residents who are complaining about the level of service they receive, or whose family is seen as difficult or undesirable.\"Most older people live happily in their care homes and many transfers between care homes are due to a legitimate reason such as a change in the residents' healthcare needs.\"These transfers are planned and agreed with the resident and their family.\"But this report highlights examples where the current contract isn't offering the adequate protections it should for care home residents.\"These examples are of non-voluntary transfers for reasons other than a change of healthcare needs and at unreasonably short timescales.\"These feel like evictions to the residents involved.\"The report calls for:Mr Lynch continued: \"Being moved from a care home can be extremely distressing for residents - the resident is suddenly removed from their home with its familiar environment, routine, staff, and community, often at a time when that person has reduced physical or mental capacity.\"Thankfully the majority of older people are secure in their care homes, receiving quality care, but the current system is open to misuse and the Department of Health needs to improve the contract to ensure all residents are treated with dignity and respect in the place they consider their home.Pauline Shepherd, from the Independent Care and Health Providers umbrella body, said this was \"not a common issue\" but said there should be \"clarity around the complaints process\" and agreed with the calls for a review of the care home contract.\"We would not normally issue notices for people to leave - that would only be used as a final straw where there was no agreement or there could be no solution,\" she said.\"A care home is someone's home,\" she continued, \"but where your home is no longer able to provide you with the level of care [you need] then that is no longer safe\".",
        "Plans for two major redevelopments at the Ebrington site in Londonderry have been approved by councillors in the city.Permission was granted for commercial offices, a multi-storey car park, a new public square and 32 residential units at a meeting on Wednesday.Separate plans for 40 apartments in two residential blocks at the site, as well as space for a mixed use office space, have also been approved. SDLP councillor Sean Mooney, who chairs Derry City and Strabane District Council's planning committee, said the plans are transformative.\u201cThis work will entirely transform the upper area of the site, and complement the extensive work that has already been carried out on the main Ebrington Square and surrounding buildings,\u201d he said.Ebrington is the largest regeneration site in Derry.A former naval base that opened in 1841, it was known as HMS Sea Eagle during World War Two and was an important part of the North Atlantic Command.The 29-acre site continued to operate as a military barracks until 2003 and was subsequently gifted to Derry by the Ministry of Defence.Some concerts and large events have been held in Ebrington Square since the former parade ground was regenerated and opened to the public in 2012.It has hosted some of the biggest music events ever held in Derry, including BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2013.But there have previously been concerns about the site's development.In 2018, work on a museum marking the city's maritime history was stalled.The following year, plans for a multi-million-pound distillery and visitors' centre at the site were scrapped.However, the council said in February of this year, that funding has now been secured to progress those museum plans, while last year a 93-room four star hotel opened at the site.Earlier this month, a bar-restaurant opened in the former military barracks' canteen.Councillor Mooney has said the approval of the latest proposals will \u201callow work to commence on the ground, as the final pieces of the jigsaw begin to fit into place at Ebrington\u201d.",

        "Private anglers on Lough Neagh can once again consume the fish they catch, after the Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirmed it was safe.During the blue-green algae crisis of summer 2023, the FSA issued precautionary advice against consuming fish caught recreationally.Its scientists wanted to be certain toxins produced by algal blooms did not accumulate in the flesh of the fish.Fish from commercial fisheries were exempt from the warning.Their facilities are subject to strict food processing guidelines.The FSA's chief scientific adviser, Prof Robin May, said test results showed toxins did not accumulate in the parts of the fish that were eaten, meaning the fish were safe as long as they were properly handled and gutted.\"With this new information, we are now advising that recreational anglers can enjoy eating the fish they catch but they should take care when handling and gutting the fish to prevent contamination of the edible parts of the fish with toxins that may be present in internal organs,\" he said.\"Before cooking or freezing the fish, fillets should be rinsed with clean water to remove any contaminants from the gutting process.\"Advice remains that recreational fishing should not take place in areas of visible algal bloom and fish that are displaying abnormal behaviours, are dead or dying should not be eaten.\"With two confirmed reports since the start of 2024, toxic blue-green algae in Lough Neagh has potentially already begun to wake up again.Last summer, it brought the largest freshwater lake in these islands to the headlines, and it brought misery to those who live and work around and on the lough.As a seventh-generation fisherman on the lough, Gary McErlain felt the effects acutely.The eels he catches every summer retreated to the lough bed beneath the suspended algae, out of reach of his nets.That meant what was a main industry on the lough during the summer \"sort of collapsed\", he said.And the thought of what could happen this year is playing on his mind.\"There was a time whenever my people my ancestors and others would have dipped their teapot into Lough Neagh and made their tea from it whenever they were out there fishing,\" he said.\"I'm not saying we're gonna get back to that anytime soon.\"But we need to get back to some sort of normality in Lough Neagh, because the whole infrastructure was broken last year.\"It is part of Ciara Laverty's job to monitor the numbers of wildlife at the lough.She has been a ranger for the Lough Neagh Partnership for four years.Blue-green algae did not stop her work, but it did have an impact on her.\"It was just a really depressing state of affairs to see it in that state,\" she said.\"Every year out on the lough, I had seen bits of algae but last year it really tipped the scales and at times, you got quite a stench from it as well.\"And I think it's a marker that the environment is changing - the ecology of Lough Neagh is changing.\"The problems of the lough were mentioned on the opening day of the newly-returned Northern Ireland Assembly and it was one of the first visits on the new agriculture, environment and rural affairs minister's agenda.Everyone agrees that there is no quick fix, but people like Martin Townsend believe the work must start now.He was part of the UK Environment Agency team which examined how the River Thames was managed.Now, as the director for the Centre of Excellence for Sustainability at the British Standards Institution, he and his staff have looked at the vulnerability of freshwater on a global scale.He said a resource like Lough Neagh was precious and fast action was required.\"The longer you leave these conversations, the more urgent they become,\" he said.\"And actually that's when things become even more fragile.\"There are complications related to the lough in terms of land ownership, competing demands, those processes of change in discussions - you won't find a perfect solution overnight.\"So actually getting the right conversations at the right pace taking place, I think, is incredibly important.\"But the longer you leave it, the more challenging it will become.\"The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) formed a working group to examine the problems of the lough and to make preparations for the expected return of the algae.It is due to report back shortly.Speaking before the Daera committee this week, the department's minister, Andrew Muir, spoke of his \"sense of shame\" about what had happened in Lough Neagh.\"The problem which was bubbling below the surface came to the top,\" he said.\"But what was bubbling below the surface occurred over decades and it occurred because of environmental mismanagement.\"And he said that if people genuinely and sincerely wanted to tackle the issues, a \"really concerted effort\" across government and society would be required.For Ciara, the silver lining to the blue-green algae crisis of 2023 is that Lough Neagh is finally getting the attention she believes it deserves.\"It is a jewel in the heart of Northern Ireland, it's got every environmental designation under the sun,\" she said.\"Everyone's still talking about the issues and it's very promising to see the new minister has made Lough Neagh a priority.\"So that fills me with hope.\"Her optimism is shared - cautiously - by Gary.\"People take Lough Neagh for granted,\" he said.\"They love it, but they take it for granted.\"And I'm heartened to see the amount of people that have actually come out of the woodwork and are putting their face to it and their voice to it.\"Surely there's enough said and done and seen now to change policy on this. We need to get the job done.\"",
        "A helicopter trip taken by a Northern Ireland assembly member to attend a Gaelic football match should be \"fully declared\", a former standards watchdog has said.Justin McNulty left the first sitting of the new assembly last month to attend the GAA game in which the team he manages was playing.He was suspended from the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in February over the matter.MLAs must publicly declare benefits.Sir Alistair Graham, former chair of a Westminster committee on standards in public life, said the helicopter journey should be recorded on the assembly's register of interests.Mr McNulty, who was appointed Laois GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) manager in October, was approached for comment.It later emerged he had travelled at least part of the more than 200-mile journey to the match, in County Wexford, by helicopter.MLAs are required to record on a public register their financial and non-financial interests, such as employment, gifts and hospitality.Guidance states they should update their interests \"within 28 days of the change occurring\".Sir Alistair said the helicopter trip \"clearly is either a gift or a benefit which should be fully declared\".He said Mr McNulty should \"personally refer himself\" to the assembly standards commissioner if he believes the trip does not need to be registered.\"As there's clearly been publicity around this particular event, and there's question marks over registration, I would have thought the sensible thing for him to do was to personally refer himself to the standards commissioner so that the matter can be fully investigated,\" he said.\"And if he feels he's done nothing wrong, then this would deal with any adverse comments that have been made publicly.\"On his register of interests, Mr McNulty said his role in Laois GAA involved an \"evening and weekend commitment for which expenses will be covered\".He recorded this as an \"unremunerated\" interest, rather than under the \"employment and earnings\" section of the register.An SDLP spokesman said: \"All MLAs are obliged to keep their assembly register of interests record up to date. As Mr McNulty has had the SDLP whip suspended, this is therefore a matter for him to address.\"Mr McNulty, who represents the Newry and Armagh constituency, was approached for comment, as was Laois GAA.A Northern Ireland Assembly spokeswoman said MLAs have \"sole responsibility for complying with the requirement to register their interests\".\"If someone believes that an MLA has not properly registered their interests in the register of members' interests, they may make a complaint to the commissioner for standards,\" she added.",

        "Jeremy Hunt has announced cuts to tax paid by workers from April, in a bid to revive Tory fortunes.The chancellor cut National Insurance by 2p in the last spring Budget before the next general election.Labour said the move was a \"con\" and would leave many people worse off.The Budget also included increases to child benefit salary thresholds and a new vaping levy, while non-dom tax status was abolished.The 2p cut on National Insurance is the second by the chancellor this year. Mr Hunt argued that it would make the tax system fairer and help revive the economy.But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, while supporting the cut, said it would not offset freezes to tax thresholds, which will see some people pay more income tax over time.He added that taxes were at a 70-year high, and people had taken an \"unprecedented hit\" to their living standards in recent years.Read more on the BudgetMr Hunt had been under pressure to cut personal taxes, with the Tories trailing Labour heavily in opinion polls ahead of the next general election, expected to take place later this year.January's cut to National Insurance, announced at last year's Autumn Statement, did not result in the bounce in the polls longed for by Tory MPs.It had fuelled speculation ahead of the Budget the chancellor would opt to cut income tax, which is thought to have a greater political impact with voters.But despite this, he announced a widely-trailed 2p cut in National Insurance (NI), reducing the rate paid by employees from 10% to 8%, and from 8% to 6% for the self-employed.He also extended eligibility for child benefits for around 170,000 families, with people earning up to \u00a360,000 getting benefits in full and the threshold for them to be withdrawn entirely raised to \u00a380,000.Mr Hunt said the change to NI would be worth \u00a3450 a year to an employee on an average salary of \u00a335,000.In an interview with BBC political editor Chris Mason, he added his long-term ambition was to abolish National Insurance completely, but this would only take place when this was \"affordable\".In a bid to raise revenues elsewhere, he emulated two of Labour's flagship policies: replacing the non-dom regime for UK residents whose permanent home is overseas, and extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies to 2029.The party had earmarked extra revenue from the policies to pay for new breakfast clubs and extra hospital appointments.Labour has been keen to stress that freezes in the thresholds when people start paying income tax, slated until 2028, mean the tax burden will still rise for many, pointing as well to \"stealth\" rises in council tax.In the Commons, Sir Keir said the chancellor was attempting to \"give with one hand, take even more with the other\".He added: \"The whole country can see exactly what is happening here. They recognise a Tory con when they see it.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called the Budget a \"last-ditch attempt from the Conservative Party to cling on to power\", adding it \"reeks of desperation\".\"Never before have I seen a government deliver weaker public services, higher taxes and zero growth all at the same time,\" he added.Former ministers Suella Braverman and Sir David Davis both expressed regret that the chancellor had not opted to cut income tax.Mrs Braverman, who was sacked by the prime minister last year, also said frozen income tax thresholds had led to \"millions of low and middle-income workers being dragged into paying higher tax\" while \"unprecedented levels of low-wage, low-skilled migration\" were damaging the economy.\"The government could have fixed both problems today but did not,\" she said.The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, says the combined effect of both cuts in NI and the threshold freezes between 2021 and this April means those earning between \u00a326,000 to \u00a360,000 are better off.However, people earning less than \u00a325,000 are worse off, whilst those earning \u00a360,000 to \u00a3120,000 will see little difference.As well as making changes to the child benefit thresholds, the chancellor said he would consult on moving to a system that used household, rather than individual, income by April 2026.The current system has been criticised as unfair because the threshold is based on the highest-earning parent, rather than a family's combined salary.That means a family where two parents each earn \u00a350,000 can receive the full amount, whereas a single person earning \u00a360,000 would get nothing.The Budget comes against a backdrop of sluggish economic growth, with the country falling into recession at the end of last year.However, Mr Hunt said the economy would \"soon turn the corner\", with growth forecast to be faster than expected over the next two years.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, is also expecting inflation - the rate prices are rising - to fall to the target rate of 2% before the end of June.This suggests the government may wait until the autumn to call an election, which must be held by the end of January 2025, rather than calling a May poll.By then the economic picture is likely to have improved and there could be another opportunity to cut taxes.In other measures announced in the Budget:The move to extend the windfall tax on energy firms has prompted a backlash from some Tories, with Energy Minister Andrew Bowie and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both describing it as \"deeply disappointing\".SNP economy spokesman Drew Henry also criticised the move, adding it meant both the government and Labour were \"intent on pulling the rug from under industry's feet\".He added that a \"just transition from oil and gas\" would not happen \"if we squeeze the life out of the sector overnight\".On public services, the chancellor said he would keep the planned increase in day-to-day spending at 1% above inflation every year until 2029.However, as some departments like health and schools have protected budgets, that means others such as justice and local government could see significant budget cuts.Mr Hunt said the public sector would also need to improve efficiency to deliver better value for taxpayers.He announced investment in new technology to help free up time for doctors, nurses and police, including \u00a33.4bn to modernise NHS IT systems.",
        "The 1920s was a period when children would be seen and not heard, especially in school.So imagine the excitement when in such an austere setting, senior pupils at Garnetbank School in Glasgow were ushered to the school hall.Settled down on the polished parquet flooring, no doubt cross-legged, they were part of something that would shape the learning landscape forever.Taking place 100 years ago, it was the very first BBC experiment in providing programmes for schools.Instead of the teacher standing out front talking to them, the lesson came from a large speaker or amplifier. What they heard was a special, instructive programme put together just for them.Lord Reith, the managing director of the BBC at the time, had held a meeting in the Central Hotel in Glasgow just weeks earlier, and suggested this idea to local education bodies.Now it was about to be tested.Technical details are sparse about how the programme was broadcast into the school, which was a five minute walk away from where the BBC studio was located on Bath Street in Glasgow.The performers were in Studio 5SC in front of a huge, early model of a microphone.Prof Charles Martin, Mademoiselle Pierette Grizel and Mr J R Peddie presented a violin recital, a talk about ballads, a music lesson and even a little French language taster.About 100 pupils and interested spectators listened in the school hall, and they must have liked what they heard.The broadcast seemed to prove the concept that providing educational programmes for school would capture the attention of pupils and that they would be able to learn in this way.It gave the BBC confidence to start making regular schools broadcasts, and the team in Glasgow were broadcasting for Scottish schools just months later.By the 1960s, programmes for schools were available on television.There was a published timetable for teachers, which meant they could book their school's television to be wheeled into the classroom, or make a trip to the television room.Alison Douglas has retired, but still works as a supply teacher at Garnetbank School.She says she has valued schools programmes throughout her 48-year teaching career.\"It took the children outside of Glasgow and outside the school,\" she said.\"Children need lots of different stimulus, and there were lots of benefits for children who learned in different ways.\"Asked about her favourite schools programmes, she remembered a \"fabulous\" show called Numbertime.\"This character called El Nombre would swing in and shout to the kids: 'What number is it?'\"They would all shout seven, seven! And he'd swing back out again.\"The kids all loved El Nombre. It was the highlight of their week and a highlight for me too, because he was funny.\"Teachers could also use programmes made by the BBC in Scotland which were specifically aimed at the Scottish curriculum.These included Around Scotland; See You See Me; Let's See; and What? Where? When? Why? featuring the Happy Gang.Bitesize is now the corporation's education brand, and BBC Scotland is still commissioning shows to reflect the country's curriculum.However, these days they are more likely to be more interactive and can all be found on the BBC Bitesize website.Derek Farrell, from Scotland Bitesize, says pupils can now use the material when it suits them - on a laptop, tablet or phone; at home or in the classroom.However, when the Covid pandemic struck they very quickly responded with a more traditional approach.\"We were very lucky to have the BBC Scotland channel,\" he said.\"We packaged up our material online and added some new content into TV programmes, so there was a schedule and an appointment to view.\"Children, teachers and parents knew there would be a time in the morning they could sit down and know there was something of quality on the television they could definitely learn from.\"I think that sense of familiarity - it was what parents knew from sitting down for broadcasts - was very helpful, and we continued that for months.\"",

        "There are many sins in the story of 'Stakeknife', and many questions that wait for answers. On Friday, the interim report of Operation Kenova will be published - an investigation established in 2016 under the command of then Bedfordshire Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, who now holds the most-senior rank in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.His task was to probe the activities of an alleged Army agent - an investigation that would shine a torch not just on the military and MI5, but inside the IRA.As Brian Rowan, BBC News NI's former security editor, now writes, there is \"a truth\" that could bring the roof down, but will it ever be told in all of its ugly detail?\"The dogs in the street know that Fred Scappaticci is the agent Stakeknife,\" says Belfast lawyer Kevin Winters.In the spring of 2003, I came face-to-face with 'Stakeknife' - with Fred Scappaticci.It happened after he had been in hiding for some days; forced to run and chased by headlines calling him an agent.He would have known the consequences.For years he had run internal IRA interrogations, at a time when he was also working for the Army.Back in May 2003 he left his home and, then, came back to deny the allegation.But the scandal of Stakeknife is this; that for years, an Army agent operating inside the IRA was employed and paid in a role that involved him culling that organisation of other suspected agents.The bodies on the border, and elsewhere, sometimes almost naked and with hands and feet bound, tell the stories of what happened next.The Army, and others in that intelligence community, cannot in any credible way deny knowledge of his role and actions.This case crossed every line.On Friday, Operation Kenova, a seven-year police investigation costing about \u00a340m, will produce an interim report.And, I am told that we can expect to read something about apologies on Friday - that the report will ask for these.What might that look like?From the UK government, an apology for what could have been prevented, and from republicans, an apology for IRA murders and for how families were intimidated and ostracised.I believe that the IRA acquiesced in Scappaticci's denial to manage him and them out of a predicament.There are fears that it won't; concerns shared by the Belfast lawyer, Kevin Winters.\"Many people will be sceptical if Kenova cannot name Fred Scappaticci as Stakeknife,' he says.\"They will with good reason query the use of NCND [a longstanding policy used to neither confirm nor deny sensitive information] to prevent naming him.\"I am hearing that Jon Boutcher wants a review of that NCND policy, and that we can expect to read more about that on Friday.Would such a review allow for a conclusive statement in the final report that Scappaticci was Stakeknife?And would it enable the Kenova team to give more information to families?Scappaticci is dead now, adding to the argument that he should be named now as the agent Stakeknife and that the NCND policy should \"be set aside\" - \"especially after a cost of \u00a340 million,\" Mr Winters argues.\"This will compound families' disappointment after all the recent PPS decisions not to prosecute anyone.\"The dogs in the street know that Fred Scappaticci is the agent Stakeknife. That cost nothing.\"In my reporting years at the BBC, I experienced how Northern Ireland's then police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), \"set aside\" this policy to neither confirm nor deny the identity of informers.It happened in the summer of 1990, when the IRA killed Patrick Flood.The Derry man's body was found at the side of a border road in County Armagh.The RUC gave me its policy position, but later guided me in an unattributable briefing that Flood was not an informer - \"emphatically not\".The source said that he would \"never, never, never try to play games with [me]\".Follow-up newspaper coverage described both an \"unprecedented denial\", and a challenge to IRA claims that \"is unique in recent years\".Scappaticci may well have been stood down from the IRA's internal security unit months before that \"execution\", as it was described.Many years later, and before that organisation had formally ended its armed campaign, Scappaticci, unlike Patrick Flood, was given the benefit of the doubt by the IRA.The question is why?Was it because of the political negotiations that stretched across 2003, from spring into the autumn, in an effort to restore Stormont?Or was it because of the rank and role that Scappaticci once had within the IRA?To shoot him (as so many others were shot) would have been to accept that the internal security of the organisation had been completely compromised, and that would have opened the door to another question: If him, then who else?In many senses, he was too big a problem for the IRA to deal with.At the time, Gerry Kelly of Sinn F\u00e9in accused \"securocrats\" of an extensive briefing of British and Irish journalists, and said \"there was a clear need for full disclosure of the activities of these faceless and unaccountable agencies\".Years later, a one-time senior IRA figure told me that it would be safe to say that Scappaticci was in close contact with the republican leadership before that meeting I had with him in 2003.And his assessment was this: that the leadership had decided to go along with the denial and to deal with it later down the road.Will the Kenova report say anything about Scappaticci's contacts with the IRA in Belfast when he came out of hiding in 2003?I don't know the answer to that question.He told me then, that he had had no involvement with the republican movement for 13 years.A confirmation of sorts that he had been stood down, under suspicion, in 1990, after the security forces rescued another agent from an IRA interrogation.For years before then, Scappaticci (the Army's man) was part of another faceless and unaccountable team that ran the IRA's so-called \"courts\".This is the ugliness of the truth.Jon Boutcher arrived in Belfast in 2016 to lead the Operation Kenova investigation. He now holds the top job at the Police Service of Northern Ireland.As the lead officer for Kenova in 2016, in his first news conference, he said this: \"My principal aim in taking responsibility for this investigation is to bring those responsible for these awful crimes, in whatever capacity they were involved, to justice.\"Scappaticci is dead.There will be no prosecutions.The truth and lies of Stakeknife will not be tested in court.Fred Scappaticci was Stakeknife - and this I am told is the only conclusion you can arrive at in the reading of this interim report.He was a jigsaw piece in a much bigger picture that has not yet been made - just one of many agents.In the numerous legacy consultations and negotiations here, how we remember the past has always been a part of the conversation.And, I am hearing that a \"day of reflection\", first developed by the Healing Through Remembering project in 2007 and, then, supported, two years later, by the Consultative Group on the Past (Eames/Bradley), will again feature in the Kenova Report.There is a lot to think about. And so much we still don't know, especially when it comes to the so-called 'dirty war'.",

        "West Midlands Police trialled a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in a bid to deal with rising volumes of non-emergency calls.Sensitive technical details of the plan were erroneously published online in a document seen by the BBC.It set out potential risks of the AI, including whether the system, dubbed \"Amy101\", would understand local \"Brummie\" accents.West Midlands Police has insisted \"robust safeguards\" were in place.Based on the tech behind Amazon's popular voice assistant, Alexa, the trial explored how AI could help the force cope with increasing volumes of calls, and potentially offer new services such as responses in different languages.A document detailing the plan was mistakenly posted online by the office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The document, marked \"official sensitive\" and with warnings that it was \"not to be publicly disclosed\", has since been removed.Amy101 was designed to speak or text-chat in order to deal with callers' inquiries and was expected to handle about 200 calls per day.The project, a two month proof-of-concept trial, was nationally funded.It was - the document suggested - the first such project where an AI-powered tool would speak to callers, though other forces were also exploring uses of the tech.Amy101 had the ability to prioritise vulnerable callers, by looking out for certain keywords - such as those referencing domestic violence - and ensuring they were next-in-line to be dealt with by a human call operator, the document says.Through speech or text chat it could direct calls, provide advice on issues such as reporting criminal damage, or requesting a crime update.West Midlands Police told the BBC the trial began on 19 December 2023 and had now concluded.Its director of commercial services, Peter Gillett, said - by the time the trial started - the force had already improved and was now \"one of the top-performing police forces for managing emergency and non-emergency calls\".The document - prepared for an ethical oversight committee that advises the PCC and Chief Constable - reveals the potential problems that might arise with Amy101, including whether the tech could cope with the local accent.\"Bias will naturally occur within the \"Amy\" system based on accents/localisation - for example can she understand \"Brummie\" accents? And are they treated with equal weighting to different accents in English?\" the document asks.Because Alexa is used globally - coping with a range of accents and languages - it was hoped that this type of bias had been removed. And if calls were not understood they would be transferred to the queue for a human operator.Mr Gillett said the force recognised that technologies capable of understanding ordinary language were \"not flawless\", and therefore may struggle with accents.As a result the force used a \"large-scale\" system \"to mitigate this bias\".Potential issues around safeguarding data were also flagged, including the risk calls would be used to help train the Amazon AI system, called Lex V2, behind Amy101.Some calls could include personally identifiable information. The document provides the example, \"My name is Marc and I want to report my house was broken into\u2026..\".The police can, however, opt-out of this kind of training and will do this \"where viable\", the document says.The ethics committee also had a number of questions, recorded in its minutes, about Amy101, such as the voice and \"gendered name\" of the tool. The force responded arguing \"humanisation\" was needed.It also suggested officers requested further analysis from Amazon on potential issues \"such as regional accent recognition and bias testing\".It is not clear whether the concerns raised in the document ever materialised, though police struck a positive note about the outcome of the trial:\"AI (Artificial Intelligence) does present some potential opportunities for providing a more efficient and robust service\", Mr Gillett said.Now the \"proof-of-concept\" trial is over, the force would be \"sharing the results and outcomes at a national scale\", he added.According to the document the government was also interested in the trial - it said a Home Office team was \"keeping a close eye\" on it with a view to wider uses.",
        "Her own engagement ring led Chie Murakami into a new line of international development work: improving life for miners. As founder and chief executive of Diamonds for Peace, a nongovernmental organization based in Japan, Ms. Murakami, 50, has been trying to improve the environmental and socio-economic conditions of diamond mining communities in developing countries, particularly Liberia. The organization\u2019s mission is threefold, Ms. Murakami said: raising awareness of the issues surrounding diamond mining, helping to support the workers and providing emergency aid in the event of a crisis.What made you decide to establish Diamonds for Peace?I received my engagement ring in 2007. I didn\u2019t know much about diamonds at that time, so I searched the internet looking for happy and fun stories about diamonds. But I didn\u2019t find any of those, and I was shocked to learn about issues like conflict diamonds or child labor. After learning those issues, I started thinking about what I could do using my experience in international development working in Laos, Haiti, Kenya.Why Liberia?I visited Sierra Leone in 2012 to see the reality after the movie \u201cBlood Diamond.\u201d But I didn\u2019t see much room for me to go in as a new group to do something. After I came back to Japan, a Japanese friend who used to work in Liberia as a U.N. volunteer introduced me to her Liberian friend. In 2014, he arranged my trip to mining communities in Liberia so I could talk to the people and observe how mining was carried out. When I came back to the Liberian capital, Monrovia, I saw a deputy minister at the Ministry of Mines, who was leading the effort to develop a policy to organize all the miners into cooperatives. Because I was thinking about the fair trade of diamonds \u2014 and one of the prerequisites for fair trade is that workers have to be organized into cooperatives or unions \u2014 I thought we were working in the same direction.What are some specific issues affecting the artisanal mining communities in Liberia?A major issue is extreme poverty. A worker at the diamond mine only gets around $300 a year. The miners are trapped in a poverty cycle. Usually, minerals belong to the government, so they have to have a mining license. While many miners had a license at some point in the past, most of them don\u2019t have the money to renew it, and it means that most of the miners are mining illicitly. Because they don\u2019t have a valid license, they cannot sell their diamonds to licensed brokers or licensed dealers, so they just sell the diamonds to a local investor who doesn\u2019t have a license for brokerage. And then those diamonds can get smuggled to other countries.The Liberian government estimates that about half of the diamonds produced in Liberia get smuggled to other countries.",

        "Colombia is a bird watcher\u2019s paradise. Its stunningly diverse ecosystems \u2014 which include mountain ranges, mangrove swamps, Caribbean beaches and Amazonian rainforests \u2014 are home to more avian species than any other country on Earth.So when Hamish Spencer, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, booked a bird-watching vacation in Colombia, he was hoping to spot some interesting and unusual creatures.He got more than he bargained for. During one outing, in early January 2023, the proprietor of a local farm drew his attention to a green honeycreeper, a small songbird that is common in forests ranging from southern Mexico to Brazil.But this particular green honeycreeper had highly unusual plumage. The left side of its body was covered in shimmering spring-green feathers, the classic coloring for females. Its right side, however, was iridescent blue, the telltale marker of a male. The bird appeared to be a bilateral gynandromorph: female on one side and male on the other.\u201cIt was just incredible,\u201d Dr. Spencer said. \u201cWe were lucky to see it.\u201dGynandromorphism has been documented in a variety of birds, as well as insects, crustaceans and other organisms. But it\u2019s a relatively rare and poorly understood phenomenon. The bird Dr. Spencer saw in Colombia is only the second known case of bilateral gynandromorphism in a green honeycreeper \u2014 and the first documented in the wild. (The only previous example was reported more than a century ago and was based on a museum specimen, Dr. Spencer said. That bird displayed the opposite pattern, with female plumage on the right and male plumage on the left.)It is not entirely clear how the condition comes about, but one leading theory is that it results from an error during the production of egg cells in female birds. Female birds have two different sex chromosomes, designated W and Z, while males have two Z chromosomes. An error during egg cell production could result in two fused or incompletely separated cells, one with a W chromosome and one with a Z chromosome.",
        "China unleashed the full might of its solar energy industry last year. It installed more solar panels than the United States has in its history. It cut the wholesale price of panels it sells by nearly half. And its exports of fully assembled solar panels climbed 38 percent while its exports of key components almost doubled.Get ready for an even bigger display of China\u2019s solar energy dominance.While the United States and Europe are trying to revive renewable energy production and help companies fend off bankruptcy, China is racing far ahead.At the annual session of China\u2019s legislature this week, Premier Li Qiang, the country\u2019s second-highest official after Xi Jinping, announced that the country would accelerate the construction of solar panel farms as well as wind and hydroelectric projects.With China\u2019s economy stumbling, the ramped-up spending on renewable energy, mainly solar, is a cornerstone of a big bet on emerging technologies. China\u2019s leaders say that a \u201cnew trio\u201d of industries \u2014 solar panels, electric cars and lithium batteries \u2014 has replaced an \u201cold trio\u201d of clothing, furniture and appliances.The goal is to help offset a steep slump in China\u2019s housing construction sector. China hopes to harness emerging industries like solar power, which Mr. Xi likes to describe as \u201cnew productive forces,\u201d to re-energize an economy that has slowed for more than a decade.The emphasis on solar power is the latest installment in a two-decade program to make China less dependent on energy imports.",
        "The trade relationship between China and the United States has plenty of friction. But at least one area is booming: Chinese start-ups looking to establish a presence in the West are spending billions of dollars for advertisements on services owned by some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology companies.Temu, the international arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is flooding Google with ads for absurdly inexpensive goods. With an initial public offering looming, the fast-fashion merchant Shein is inundating Instagram with ads for clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices. Developers of China\u2019s video streaming and gaming apps are dumping marketing dollars into Facebook, X and YouTube to entice potential users.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said on a call with analysts that Chinese-based advertisers accounted for 10 percent of its revenue, almost double over two years ago. In the last year, Temu has placed about 1.4 million ads globally across Google services, and at least 26,000 different versions of ads on Meta, according to Meta\u2019s Ad Library.\u201cWhat companies like Temu have done is really just open a fire hose of money that it is pouring into ads,\u201d said Sky Canaves, senior analyst for retail at eMarketer. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape their ads across Facebook, Instagram and Google Search.\u201dThe surge in spending shows how interconnected China and the United States remain, despite vigorous efforts by each country to be more self-reliant. The Chinese companies are gaining access to vast audiences of consumers, and the Silicon Valley companies are making money off a market they are otherwise not doing business in.The marketing blitz is fueled by the global ambitions of Chinese start-ups. At home, the economy is no longer growing by leaps and bounds as it had for years, and companies are subject to a thicket of government rules that have quashed their growth.",
        "On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was heading from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to Beijing, when it deviated from its scheduled path, turning west across the Malay Peninsula.The plane, a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people from 15 countries, is believed to have veered off course and flown south for several hours after radar contact was lost. Some officials believe it may have crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean after running out of fuel, but expansive search efforts over years have returned no answers, no victims, and no plane.The reason the plane went off course and its exact location today remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time. This week, officials suggested a renewed search operation might be undertaken.Here\u2019s a brief look at what we know about the plane\u2019s disappearance 10 years later.The first phase of the search lasted 52 days and was conducted largely from the air, covering 1.7 million square miles and involving 334 search flights.In January 2017, the governments of Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the underwater search for the plane after combing more than 46,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean floor. That effort cost $150 million.",

This year, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the Exchequer, had to consider another priority: the upcoming general election.And so on Wednesday, Mr. Hunt announced that he would cut taxes for nearly 30 million workers.

It will save the typical employee about 900 pounds ($1,145) a year, Mr. Hunt said.A year and a half ago, tax cuts and a plan to turbocharge economic growth sent shock waves through financial markets and ultimately pushed Liz Truss out of her job as prime minister.

Each fund-raiser is then highlighted in a social media post with their picture, tapping into civilians\u2019 desire to be recognized as active participants in the war effort.\u201cThey need to be able to tell themselves, \u2018I\u2019m doing something, I\u2019m helping,\u2019\u201d Ms. Chervona, 28, said in a recent interview. \u201cI simply understood that any reasonably active person on Instagram could pull in 50K,\u201d she added, referring to 50,000 Ukrainian hryvnias, about $1,300.Since the early days of the war, thousands of volunteers have led crowdfunding efforts that have been crucial in supplying the Ukrainian military with critical equipment. They have become part of Ukraine\u2019s social fabric, with nearly 80 percent of the population now donating, according to a recent survey.But as the conflict drags on, and with momentum on the battlefield shifting to Russia, fund-raisers say it has become harder to raise money. That has prompted people like Ms. Chervona to borrow heavily from sales and marketing techniques to keep donations flowing. They have held auctions, organized raffles and invited influencers to participate in promotional clips.",
        "When Benny Gantz, a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet, met David Cameron, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, in London on Wednesday, he got a sharp message that Israel must do more to allow humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza.It was the kind of minister-level meeting that would normally draw modest attention amid the flurry of high-level diplomacy that has enveloped the Israel-Hamas war. But Mr. Gantz and Mr. Cameron are no mere functionaries.Mr. Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, is a popular political rival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed deep displeasure at what he viewed as an unsanctioned trip by a would-be Israeli leader.Mr. Cameron, a former prime minister, has enjoyed uncommon latitude as foreign secretary, speaking out forcefully on issues like Gaza and the war in Ukraine on international trips, where he is often treated as though he were still in his old job.The unusual optics of the meeting \u2014 almost two shadow leaders \u2014 speak to the peculiar domestic politics in each country. Israel is in the grip of a devastating war that has pulled Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz into a temporary alliance. Britain is in the twilight stages of an era of Conservative-led governments, with a prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who is more occupied with a general election later this year than with foreign policy.For Britain, diplomats and experts said, deploying Mr. Cameron to deliver a tough message to Israel is valuable because it will register more than if it came from a standard-issue cabinet minister. It also spares Mr. Sunak the political risk of pressing Mr. Netanyahu directly and potentially being rebuffed.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has agreed to more than double a bailout package for Egypt, which is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, exacerbated by war in the neighboring Gaza Strip and in Ukraine.The fund now plans to provide Egypt $8 billion, up from an initial $3 billion announced in October 2022.The I.M.F.\u2019s mission chief to Egypt, Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, noted at a news conference that the already-struggling Egyptian economy had been further hurt by the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has cut into the country\u2019s vital tourism trade.At the same time, revenue from the Suez Canal dropped by half after Houthi militants, who say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, began attacking cargo ships using Red Sea shipping routes.Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly of Egypt said that the deal would enable the government to secure an additional $1.2 billion, above the $8 billion, from the I.M.F.\u2019s environmental suitability fund and would encourage development partners like the World Bank and the European Union to also give Egypt more loans to help it reach financial stability.Last week, Egypt secured a deal worth $35 billion with the United Arab Emirates to develop parts of its Mediterranean coast. Egyptian officials celebrated it as the largest foreign direct investment in Egypt\u2019s history.",
        "Talks between Israel and Hamas over the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have stalled, dimming hopes that a deal could be reached before Ramadan begins in a few days, according to several people briefed on the conversations.Negotiators had been discussing a proposal for an initial six-week cease-fire during which Hamas would release about 40 people \u2014 including women, elderly and ill hostages, and five female Israeli soldiers \u2014 for a substantial number of Palestinian prisoners.The discussions included terms for releasing at least 15 prisoners convicted of serious acts of terrorism who would be exchanged for the female soldiers. The terms also said Israel would release hundreds of other detainees or prisoners, at an average of 10 Palestinians for every Israeli civilian freed, officials said.American officials had said that they hoped to reach an agreement to release some hostages and put in place a temporary pause in fighting before Ramadan, which is expected to start this Sunday. President Biden expressed confidence last week that a deal was within reach.But in recent days, Hamas has backed away from the proposed agreement and made demands that Israel refuses to meet, according to officials briefed on the talks. The negotiations had been taking place in Doha, Qatar, before they moved to Cairo in recent days.John F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, said on Wednesday that while the United States was disappointed that an agreement had not been reached, negotiators were still confident in the parameters of the deal they had helped negotiate.\u201cIt is just a matter of getting Hamas to sign on,\u201d he said.Hamas, Mr. Kirby said, had been engaging in proposals and counterproposals, working with the other parties to develop the framework of the agreement.\u201cThere had been a robust back and forth on the details, but the fact that we are not there yet is an indication that the details still are not all worked out,\u201d he said.One official in the region said the main point of difference is the same one that has hovered over the talks for weeks: Hamas wants Israel to commit now to a permanent cease-fire during or after three phases of hostage releases, while Israel refuses to do so. Israel wants to focus on an agreement for the terms of the first phase only, a position the United States supports. Until now, the discussions around the first phase have centered on the potential release of those 40 people, out of about 100 remaining hostages.The Israeli delegation has not attended the sessions in Cairo because of Hamas\u2019s new demands. Israeli officials said they believed a broad consensus for the first phase of the agreement had been reached, only to have Hamas renew its push for broader demands.Besides the permanent cease-fire, Hamas is also insisting on a withdrawal of Israeli troops from northern Gaza after the third phase of the hostage releases and greater aid into Gaza, with a guarantee that half go to northern Gaza, the official in the region said. These demands are ones that can be worked out between the Israeli government and Hamas, officials said.The people briefed on the talks in Egypt declined to be identified by name or nationality, citing the fragile nature of the negotiations. A Hamas official did not respond to a request for comment.The United States had been pushing for an agreement to be reached before Ramadan, worried that the situation could become more intractable during the holy month of fasting. Frustration and tempers could flare then, making an agreement far more difficult to achieve, U.S. officials said.American officials continue to push for a deal. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met in Washington with Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet who might eventually challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his office.After the meeting, the main State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Mr. Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of reaching an agreement to achieve the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, which would lead to a temporary cease-fire and allow additional humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza.\u201dThe same day, Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani of Qatar, the most senior Qatari negotiator in the hostage talks, spoke with Mr. Blinken separately in Washington during a previously scheduled meeting on common strategic concerns. Both men told reporters it was important to try to get hostages released and some form of cease-fire.Qatar and Egypt have been bringing proposals to Hamas political and military leaders. The United States has tried to draft broad proposals to restart the talks after they hit various roadblocks following an initial seven-day pause in November during which Hamas released about 100 hostages, mainly civilians.People familiar with the negotiations believe Hamas has issued new demands for a variety of reasons.On Feb. 28, Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas political leader based in Qatar, called publicly for a march during Ramadan in Jerusalem at the Al Aqsa Mosque, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. Some Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019s military wing wants those protests to turn violent. Hamas may want to avoid a cease-fire deal for fear of being accused of breaking it if the protests become violent.Hamas, according to people briefed on the talks, believes an action at the mosque will show its strength despite the monthslong Israeli military campaign in Gaza and could increase pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to end the fighting.But Hamas may have made new demands during the negotiations for another reason.Last Thursday, Israeli forces opened fire in Gaza while a crowd had gathered near a long convoy of aid trucks. The chaotic scene led to more than 100 deaths.U.S. officials harshly criticized Israel\u2019s handling of the convoy and its failure to provide security for desperate Palestinian people.Some officials briefed on the talks say Hamas leaders may believe the deaths around the humanitarian convoy have strengthened their position in the negotiations and weakened Israel\u2019s international standing.",
        "The Israeli government has decided against putting new restrictions on access to an important mosque in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a move that may reduce tensions at a site that has long been a flashpoint for unrest.At a meeting on Tuesday night led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, security officials decided to let a similar number of worshipers enter the Aqsa Mosque compound during Ramadan as they had in previous years, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said. Ramadan, whose start is tied to the sighting of the crescent moon, is expected to begin in a few days.Israel has long restricted access to the compound, which is sacred to Muslims and Jews alike, during Ramadan for Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This year, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, called on the government to impose limits on Arab citizens of Israel as well.The decision on Tuesday put an end to the plan promoted by Mr. Ben-Gvir, but it allowed some wiggle room. \u201cA weekly assessment of the security and safety aspects will be held; a decision will be made accordingly,\u201d a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said.The mosque compound has regularly been the scene of violent clashes. Confrontations at the site in May 2021 contributed to the outbreak of an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.With Ramadan nearing as the current Israel-Hamas war enters its sixth month, the fear of escalation at the site has intensified. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said that if a cease-fire deal was not reached by Ramadan, \u201cit\u2019s going to be very dangerous.\u201dMansour Abbas, an Arab Israeli member of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, praised the decision. \u201cI congratulate the Prime Minister for the responsible decision to allow Muslim worshipers at Al Aqsa Mosque freedom of worship,\u201d he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Mr. Ben-Gvir, however, expressed concern that the decision would undermine Israel\u2019s effort to destroy the militant group Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7. \u201cHamas celebrations on the Temple Mount \u2260 complete victory,\u201d he wrote on X, using the name used by Jews to refer to Al Aqsa.Hamas previously condemned any Israeli restrictions on worship at Al Aqsa. On Monday, a Hamas leader called on Palestinians to turn the mosque into a site of confrontation.Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem should \u201cturn every moment of Ramadan into a clash and confrontation with the enemy to protect Al Aqsa,\u201d Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader based in Beirut, told a conference of Muslim scholars by video.In Muslim tradition, the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven from the site of Al Aqsa, and tens of thousands of Muslims visit the mosque every day during Ramadan. For Jews, the area is revered as the Temple Mount because it was the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity that remain central to Jewish identity.",
        "When President Biden suggested last week that a cease-fire was imminent, Khalil el-Halabi was elated.Mr. Halabi, a 70-year-old retired U.N. official, paraded through a cluster of tents in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, delivering the news to people displaced by the war, prompting cheers and claps. But the joy didn\u2019t last: The next morning, reports that gaps remained between Israel and Hamas brought him back down to earth.\u201cIt\u2019s a form of psychological torture,\u201d Mr. Halabi said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable. We\u2019re told one day that the war is ending and then the opposite the next day.\u201dPalestinians in Gaza, whose lives may depend on a cease-fire, have followed news of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas with rapt attention. But a stream of conflicting reports has sent them on an exhausting emotional roller-coaster as they huddle in crowded apartments, tent cities and shelters.The tension is especially acute in Rafah, which is densely packed with more than one million displaced people. Israel has repeatedly threatened to invade the city as it tries to root out the leadership of Hamas.The United States is pressing for a cease-fire to be negotiated ahead of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month that begins in about a week. On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris said a deal was on the table for a cease-fire of at least six-weeks, one that would include the release of hostages held by militants in Gaza and the entry of a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of aid. The U.S.-backed proposal is to exchange scores of Palestinian prisoners and detainees for 40 hostages in Gaza, officials say.",
        "Meeting with a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet on Wednesday, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary said Israel must help get far more food and other supplies into the Gaza Strip to address the humanitarian crisis there, the secretary said after they spoke.\u201cI once again pressed Israel to increase the flow of aid,\u201d the foreign secretary, David Cameron, said in a statement. \u201cWe are still not seeing improvements on the ground. This must change.\u201dThe Israeli cabinet member, Benny Gantz, a former army chief, visited London after hearing similar messages in Washington from U.S. officials. Mr. Gantz\u2019s office said that he also met Wednesday with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Mr. Sunak\u2019s national security adviser, Tim Barrow.A statement about the meetings released by Mr. Gantz\u2019s office did not mention such prodding. It said that he spoke of the importance of pressuring Hamas to release hostages, of \u201cthe just and necessary goal of removing the threat of Hamas,\u201d and of Israel\u2019s appreciation for Britain's support of Israel, particularly in combating Houthi militants in Yemen who fire missiles at ships.On Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Gantz held closed-door meetings with Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Jake Sullivan, President Biden\u2019s national security adviser. The trip by Mr. Gantz, the top political rival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was not authorized by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government, the prime minister\u2019s office has said.Ms. Harris praised Israel\u2019s \u201cconstructive approach\u201d to seeking a six-week cease-fire but urged the government to do more to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza.",
        "Israelis largely welcomed a U.N. report that supported allegations of sexual violence during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, even as a top Israeli official accused the United Nations of not doing enough to address the findings \u2014 a sign of the rising tensions between them.The U.N. report, released on Monday, found both \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that sexual violence against multiple people had occurred in at least three locations in Israel, and \u201cclear and convincing information\u201d that hostages taken to Gaza on Oct. 7 had been subjected to sexual violence, including rape.On Tuesday, President Isaac Herzog of Israel said on X that the report was \u201cof immense importance,\u201d and he lauded it for its \u201cmoral clarity and integrity.\u201dBut Israel Katz, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, accused the U.N. secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in a social media post of making a concerted effort to \u201cforget the report and avoid making the necessary decisions.\u201d In protest, Mr. Katz recalled Israel\u2019s representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, for consultations \u2014 a step short of withdrawing the ambassador for a longer term. Mr. Erdan was on a plane back to Israel on Tuesday, he said.A U.N. spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said he did not accept \u2014 or even understand \u2014 the criticism, and that the report was done \u201cthoroughly and expeditiously\u201d and that \u201cin no way, shape or form did the secretary general do anything to \u2018bury\u2019 the report.\u201d U.N. officials alerted journalists in advance of the report\u2019s release and held a news conference to discuss it, and the report received extensive news coverage.Mr. Guterres has been an outspoken critic of Israel\u2019s invasion of the Gaza Strip and has been pushing for an immediate and binding cease-fire. And there is deep distrust of the United Nations among Israelis, who see the body as biased against their country \u2014 a fact that was noted in the report on Oct. 7.",
        "The super PAC supporting Donald J. Trump for president is airing a blistering television ad before the State of the Union address, mocking President Biden\u2019s halting response to questions about his memory and even questioning his life span, in a preview of the tenor of the general election ahead.The ad, titled \u201cJugular,\u201d aired on MSNBC on Thursday morning during one of Mr. Biden\u2019s favorite shows, \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d in the 6 a.m. hour. It will air nationally through the day and Friday morning on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and Newsmax, according to the super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc. The size of the two-day ad buy was not immediately clear.The spot appeared designed to try to get under Mr. Biden\u2019s skin at a pivotal moment, as he prepares to give the State of the Union and faces low job approval ratings against his predecessor, Mr. Trump. The ad focuses on a topic that Mr. Biden and his allies have shown frustration about \u2014 questions over his age.At the age of 81, Mr. Biden is America\u2019s oldest president. Mr. Trump is 77.A Biden campaign spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.A report by the special counsel, Robert Hur, who was investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s possession of classified documents at his home after he served as vice president, infuriated the president\u2019s allies with what they called gratuitous descriptions of his difficulty recalling certain events and details. Among them, according to Mr. Hur, was when Mr. Biden\u2019s eldest son, Beau, passed away, a statement Mr. Biden\u2019s allies pushed back on.The ad uses footage of Mr. Biden responding to that report at a White House news conference, during which he at times seemed visibly angry and flustered. The ad says that people understand Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d and adds, \u201cCan Biden even survive until 2029?\u201d It then asks, over footage of Vice President Kamala Harris laughing and Mr. Biden falling on the stairs while boarding Air Force One, \u201cCan we?\u201dThe tactic of airing ads in order to be seen by a president was used to reach Mr. Trump, particularly when opponents were hoping to force him to react. Among those who used the tactic was the Lincoln Project, the group of anti-Trump Republicans. And Trump has had his own verbal stumbles, including confusing the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley, his erstwhile primary rival, and calling Mr. Biden \u201cObama\u201d in recent speeches.But this particular spot focuses on what has been raised by Democrats, some of Mr. Biden\u2019s allies and a number of voters as a concern, as Mr. Trump seeks to set the terms of the general election for voters as one of \u201cstrength\u201d versus \u201cweakness.\u201d\u201cBiden is weak, and America is suffering because of it,\u201d said Taylor Budowich, the chief executive of MAGA Inc. \u201cTonight\u2019s State of the Union will not silence those waiting in the wings from laughing every time Joe Biden stumbles or bumbles.\u201d",
        "When Voyager 1 launched in 1977, scientists hoped it could do what it was built to do and take up-close images of Jupiter and Saturn.

Their presence signals Mr. Biden\u2019s emphasis on an issue that has lifted Democrats in recent elections as he faces a rematch with former President Donald J.

        "Mainstream Democrats, watching the politics around Israel\u2019s war in Gaza shift against them, are pressing President Biden to become far more outspoken in his criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government and far more upfront in his demands for a long-term solution to the conflict that includes a Palestinian state.At the outset of the war, with memories fresh from Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Israel that took around 1,200 lives, Jewish Democrats who had grown restive more than a year ago over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governance largely rallied around Mr. Biden as he sided firmly with Israel.But as the death toll in Gaza rises inexorably, many are pleading with the president not so much to change policies but to become the voice of his administration\u2019s own demands for a Ramadan cease-fire, more humanitarian aid, more restraint of Jewish settler violence and a long-term peace that includes a Palestinian state.\u201cWe are hoping that a strategy for peace and an end to this nightmare will be laid out at the State of the Union,\u201d Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said on Wednesday. \u201cNobody can question Biden\u2019s commitment to the security of Israel, and nobody can question his commitment over the course of his career to human rights and international law. Now is the time when the world needs to see American leadership for peace.\u201dMr. Raskin, returning to earlier criticism of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, the most right-wing in Israel\u2019s history, added, \u201cDemocrats feel we don\u2019t take orders from right-wing politicians in America, and we shouldn\u2019t be taking orders from right-wing politicians in another country.\u201dMore than a dozen Jewish Democrats in the House spearheaded a critical letter late last month demanding Mr. Biden \u201credouble\u201d his efforts to achieve a cease-fire that facilitates more humanitarian aid to starving Gazans.

        "The State of the Union address on Thursday is likely to be President Biden\u2019s best opportunity before November to tell Americans at length about his record in office and what he would do in a second term.It\u2019s not technically a campaign speech, since he will deliver it in his official capacity from the floor of the House of Representatives, but for American presidents in the last year of their first term, the annual address represents the kickoff to their re-election effort.Mr. Biden will deliver the speech, which typically runs for an hour or more, from a position of political vulnerability but with a host of policy accomplishments to play up. And it comes just as the long-anticipated matchup between him and his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, is settling into place.The speech will address big themes like Mr. Biden\u2019s attempts to restore democracy, and highlight smaller, more personal policy changes his administration has enacted, such as fighting credit card fees and lowering prescription drug costs, the White House told allies in a briefing about the speech Wednesday, according to a person who attended the session.Here are six questions facing Mr. Biden before he steps to the rostrum on Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern.This one is pretty simple: Donald Trump is a dire threat to democracy and Americans\u2019 freedoms.How fine a point Mr. Biden puts on this message in the State of the Union is a different question. It would break with decades of political tradition to attack a campaign rival by name during the address, but Mr. Biden and allied Democrats have argued throughout his campaign that 2024 may be an inflection point that calls for unusual measures.",
        "President Biden enters his State of the Union speech on Thursday with an economic record that has defied forecasters\u2019 gloomy expectations, avoiding recession while delivering stronger growth and lower unemployment than predicted.But polls suggest voters know relatively little about the legislation Mr. Biden has signed into law that seeks to boost the economy through spending and tax breaks for infrastructure, clean energy, semiconductors and more.They remain frustrated over high prices, particularly for groceries and housing, even though the rapid inflation that defined Mr. Biden\u2019s early years in office has cooled. Mr. Biden consistently trails his predecessor and likely November opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, on economic issues.His speech on Thursday will try to make the case for the success of \u201cBidenomics.\u201d Mr. Biden will begin to hint at what his agenda might bring in a second term, including efforts to increase corporate taxes and to reduce the cost of housing, one of the most tangible examples of what Mr. Biden calls his attempts to build an economy that prioritizes workers and the middle class.Mr. Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech will \u201cdiscuss the historic achievements he\u2019s delivered for the American people and lay out his vision for the future,\u201d Lael Brainard, who heads the president\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters ahead of the speech. She stressed recent wage gains, low unemployment and new factory construction that she said were linked to Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda.Ms. Brainard and other administration officials said the president would try to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump on economic issues during his annual speech, including on tax policy and reducing consumer costs. Mr. Biden\u2019s aim is to cast Mr. Trump and his Republican Party as allies of the wealthy and large corporations instead of Americans who are struggling with rising costs.",
        "Opening statements are set to begin Thursday morning in the trial of James Crumbley, in the same Pontiac, Mich., courtroom where his wife was convicted last month for failing to stop their son from carrying out the worst school shooting in Michigan history.Mr. Crumbley faces the same charges as his wife, Jennifer Crumbley: four counts of involuntary manslaughter for the four students killed by their son, who was 15 when he opened fire in a hallway at Oxford High School on Nov. 30, 2021.The teenager, Ethan, pleaded guilty last year to 24 charges, including first-degree murder. But in a rare move, prosecutors have also sought to hold his parents criminally responsible, saying they neglected warning signs about their son\u2019s mental health and plans for the deadly rampage, which also injured seven people.Their lawyers have said that the couple had no inkling that their son was capable of such violence, and Ms. Crumbley, 45, testified that she had not seen him as a danger to others. Jurors, however, found her guilty after 11 hours of deliberation.Mr. Crumbley, 47, who requested a separate trial, will face a different jury but many of the same arguments from prosecutors, along with an additional factor for the jurors to consider: He bought the 9-millimeter Sig Sauer handgun that his son used to kill his schoolmates, Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16; Justin Shilling, 17; and Hana St. Juliana, 14.That purchase, which happened four days before the shooting and was intended as an early Christmas present, \u201cis the one differentiating factor that makes his case more of an uphill battle\u201d for Mr. Crumbley, said Mark Chutkow, a lawyer and former federal prosecutor in Michigan.",
        "A specialized laboratory examining the brain of the gunman who committed Maine\u2019s deadliest mass shooting found profound brain damage of the kind that has been seen in veterans exposed to repeated blasts from weapons use.The lab\u2019s findings were included in an autopsy report that was compiled by the Maine chief medical examiner\u2019s office and released by the gunman\u2019s family.The gunman, Robert Card, was a grenade instructor in the Army Reserve. In 2023, after eight years of being exposed to thousands of skull-shaking blasts on the training range, he began hearing voices and was stalked by paranoid delusions, his family said. He grew increasingly erratic and violent in the months before the October rampage in Lewiston, in which he killed 18 people and then himself.His brain was sent to a Veterans Affairs laboratory in Boston that is known for its pioneering work documenting chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., in athletes.According to the lab\u2019s report, prepared on Feb. 26 and updated on Wednesday, the white matter that forms the wiring deep in the brain had \u201cmoderately severe\u201d damage, and in some areas was missing entirely. The delicate tissue sheaths that insulate each biological circuit lay in \u201cdisorganized clumps,\u201d and throughout Mr. Card\u2019s brain there was scarring and inflammation suggesting repeated trauma.This was not C.T.E., the report said. It was a characteristic pattern of damage that has been found before in military veterans who were repeatedly exposed to weapons blasts during their service.\u201cWhile it is unclear whether these pathological findings are responsible for Mr. Card\u2019s behavioral changes in the last 10 months of life, based on our previous studies it is likely that brain injury played a role in his symptoms,\u201d the report concluded.The findings have grave implications for the military, because Mr. Card never saw combat, and had never been exposed to explosions from enemy fire or roadside bombs. The only blasts that hit his brain came from training that the Army said was safe.\u201cWe know very little about the risks of blast exposure,\u201d said Dr. Ann McKee, who leads the lab and signed the report. \u201cI think these results should be a warning. We need to do more investigation.\u201dCongress has been pushing the military in recent years to investigate whether the blasts from repeatedly firing heavy weapons cause brain damage, but the military has proceeded at a halting pace that has yielded few changes in the field.Soldiers like Mr. Card are still being exposed to large numbers of blasts from grenades, mortars, cannons and rocket launchers in training every day. And current Pentagon guidelines say that absorbing thousands of grenade blasts, as Mr. Card did over his career, poses no risk to troops\u2019 brains.In a statement on Wednesday, the Army said it had issued recommendations in recent months to reduce blast exposure in combat units. \u201cThe Army is committed to understanding, mitigating, accurately diagnosing and promptly treating blast overpressure and its effects in all forms,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile prolonged blast exposures can be potentially hazardous, even if encountered on the training range and not the battlefield, there is still a lot to learn.\u201dFor much of his life, Robert Card was a quiet, friendly, dependable man with no history of causing trouble, his family said. He grew up on his family\u2019s dairy farm in Bowdoin, Maine, and drove a delivery truck for work. He liked to fish in local ponds with his son, and often took his nieces and nephews along.\u201cHe was always there to do chores on the farm, there for the kids and Sunday dinner,\u201d his sister, Nicole Herling, said in an interview.Mr. Card joined the Army Reserve in 2002, and for his first 12 years in the service he was a petroleum supply specialist. In 2014, he was transferred to 3rd Battalion, 304th Regiment, a training unit based in Saco, Maine.Every summer, his platoon of the 3rd Battalion conducted a two-week field course for cadets from the U.S. Military Academy West Point, teaching them to use rifles, machine guns and shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons. Soldiers said that during the course, Mr. Card spent most of his time on the grenade range. Each of the 1,200 cadets had to throw at least one grenade; most threw two. Soldiers said that over the years, Mr. Card could have easily been exposed to more than 10,000 blasts.The Defense Department has a list of 14 weapons that in normal use, unleash a blast powerful enough to be potentially hazardous to the troops who use them. Grenades are not on the list. Soldiers in Mr. Card\u2019s platoon said they received no briefings about the dangers of repeated exposure.In 2022, Mr. Card began to lose his hearing. His family noticed that he was growing sullen and short-tempered. In the spring of 2023, he began to believe that people at a local market and the bar where he liked to play cornhole were talking about him behind his back, and calling him a pedophile. He also started to rapidly lose weight.His brothers and sister tried to intervene a number of times, encouraging him to see a doctor. At one point, his sister called a veterans\u2019 crisis line. But Mr. Card pushed his relatives away, they said, and accused them of conspiring against him.In July, the Army put Mr. Card in a psychiatric hospital for two weeks after he complained of hearing voices and made threats against fellow soldiers. Doctors at the hospital prescribed him lithium, his sister said, but he was not assessed for a traumatic brain injury. When he got out of the hospital, he stopped taking the medicine.Mr. Card had a number of other angry and violent interactions in the months that followed. One day, his mother came home to find him weeping on her front porch over his delusions of people talking about him.He lost his job driving a recycling truck. The police came to his parents\u2019 house in September, warning that he was making threats against soldiers in his Army unit. Mr. Card\u2019s brother and father both tried to take his guns away, but he grew angry and told them to get off his property.A few weeks later, when the local news reported that a man had opened fire in a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Mr. Card\u2019s siblings saw the video footage and recognized their brother.As the state of Maine reeled over the loss of life and argued over missed warning signs, Mr. Card\u2019s brain was shipped to Boston, where researchers examined thin cross sections of tissue.\u201cThe damage was just tremendous,\u201d said Dr. Lee Goldstein, a professor of neurology at Boston University who analyzed Mr. Card\u2019s brain tissue with an electron microscope.The long, slender, cablelike cells called axons that pass messages deep in the brain were in tatters, Dr. Goldstein said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m seeing cables that have lost their protective wrapping, cables that are just missing, cables that are inflamed and sick, cables that are essentially filled with cellular garbage bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThese cables control how one part of the brain communicates with another. If they are damaged, you can\u2019t function right.\u201dThe findings are not the first indications that the military has gotten about the possible risk of repeated blasts to grenade instructors.In 2015 and 2017, Army research teams investigated reports of instructors in Georgia and South Carolina complaining of headaches, fatigue, memory issues and confusion. The Army gathered measurements of grenade blasts, but took no broad action to limit blast exposure.Similar concerns were raised at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri in 2020. A small study funded by the Army examined the brains of new grenade and explosives instructors using PET scans. Researchers found that before they worked around blasts, the instructors brains looked healthy. But in follow-up scans five months later, their brains were teeming with an abnormal protein called beta amyloid that is associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201cIn a young brain you should see no amyloid. None. Zero,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Leiva-Salinas, the University of Missouri neuroradiologist who ran the study. \u201cWe were surprised, very surprised.\u201dMr. Card\u2019s sister said the analysis of his brain, which the family learned about on Friday, changed how the family saw the shooting and their brother.\u201cIt allowed me to forgive him,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of people are in a lot of pain,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe we can use what happened to help other people.\u201dIn a statement on Wednesday, the family wrote: \u201cWe want to begin by saying how deeply sorry and heartbroken we are for all the victims, survivors and their loved ones, and to everyone in Maine and beyond who was affected and traumatized by this tragedy.\u201d\u201cWhile we cannot go back,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cwe are releasing the findings of Robert\u2019s brain study with the goal of supporting ongoing efforts to learn from this tragedy to ensure it never happens again.\u201d",
        "The Muslim holy month of Ramadan will begin on Monday, March 11 or Tuesday, March 12, depending on the sighting of the new moon.The dawn-to-dusk fast lasts anywhere from 12 to 17 hours, depending on which part of the world you are in.Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month when the first verses of the holy book Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago.The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations during daylight hours to achieve greater \u201ctaqwa\u201d, or consciousness of God.Ramadan begins 10 to 12 days earlier each year. This is because the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar Hijri calendar with months that are 29 or 30 days long.Because the lunar year is shorter than the solar year by 11 days, Ramadan will be observed twice in the year 2030 \u2013 first beginning on January 5 and then starting on December 26.The next time Ramadan will start after March 12 will be 33 years from now \u2013 in the year 2057.The number of daylight hours varies across the world.Muslims living in the world\u2019s southernmost countries, such as Chile or New Zealand, will fast for about 12 hours, while those living in northernmost countries, such as Iceland or Greenland, will have 17-plus hours fasts.For Muslims living in the Northern Hemisphere, the number of fasting hours will be a bit shorter this year and will continue to decrease until 2031, which is the year Ramadan will encompass the winter solstice \u2013 the shortest day of the year. After that, fasting hours will increase until the summer solstice \u2013 the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.For fasting Muslims living south of the equator, the opposite will happen.In extreme northernmost cities, such as Longyearbyen in Norway, where the sun does not set from April 20 to August 22, religious rulings have been issued to follow timings in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, or the nearest Muslim country.The predawn meal to start the daily fast is called suhoor, while the breaking of one\u2019s fast after sunset is called iftar.Cities situated roughly along the same longitude will have similar iftar times, while those on the opposite side of the globe will be preparing to start their fast with suhoor.The infographic below shows which cities are having suhoor while others are having their iftar.The table below shows the suhoor and iftar times on the first and last days of Ramadan 2024.

        "Ocean temperatures hit a record high last month, which was also\u00a0the warmest February on record globally, scientists in the European Union have said.The average global sea surface temperature stood at 21.06 degrees Celsius (69.91 degrees Fahrenheit) in February, surpassing the previous record of 20.98C (69.77F) set in August 2023, in a dataset that goes back to 1979, the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday.Meanwhile, the average air temperature in February was 13.54C (56.4F), 1.77C (3.18F) warmer than the pre-industrial average for the month. It marked the ninth consecutive month that was the warmest on record for the respective month of the year.Earlier, January had also been recorded as the warmest first month of the year, surpassing the previous warmest January in 2020, as per C3S\u2019s records going back to 1950.Last month, after scientists warned of the hottest January on record as the world continued a run of exceptional heat fuelled by climate change, C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said, \u201cRapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing.\u201dFebruary 2024 was the warmest February on record according to @CopernicusECMWF\u20701.77\u00b0C warmer than pre-industrial\u20709th record breaking month in a row\u2070 \u2070Global temperatures for the past 12 months are the highest on record, at 1.56\u00b0C above pre-industrial \u2070#ClimateAction pic.twitter.com/bYrcm7nKky\u2014 Dr Sam Burgess \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf21\ud83d\udef0 (@OceanTerra) March 7, 2024The C3S scientists said while the El Nino climate pattern continued to weaken in the equatorial Pacific in February, marine air temperatures remained at an unusually high level.Marine scientists warned this week that a fourth global mass coral bleaching event is likely unfolding in the Southern Hemisphere, driven by warming waters and possibly the worst in the planet\u2019s history.Corals bleach under heat stress, expelling the colourful, helpful algae that live in their tissues, leaving behind a pale skeleton. This makes them vulnerable to starvation and disease, and many die. This can lead to the collapse of fragile reef ecosystems, with coastlines left unprotected from erosion and storms and fisheries falling short.El Nino, borne out of warmer than usual surface waters in the Eastern Pacific, alongside human-caused climate change, is fuelling the extra heat.\u201cWhat is more surprising is that sea surface temperatures are at record levels over regions far away from the centre of the El Nino action, such as the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean,\u201d said climate scientist Richard Allan of the University of Reading.This, he said, pointed to the strong influence of rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.While the global average sea surface temperature record excludes the polar oceans, things are in bad shape there, too.Antarctic sea ice reached its annual minimum extent in February, registering its third-lowest extent on record at 28 percent below average.",
        "Who: Anthony Joshua vs Francis Ngannou\nWhat: Heavyweight boxing fight (10 rounds)\nWhen: Friday, March 8, 2024 at 23:00 GMT\nWhere: Kingdom Arena, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaFrancis Ngannou believes his strong showing in his pro boxing debut against Tyson Fury has given him confidence ahead of his bout against British heavyweight Anthony Joshua in Saudi Arabia.The former UFC heavyweight champion Ngannou will fight Joshua at Riyadh\u2019s Kingdom Arena on Friday.Ngannou made his debut in October, losing via split decision to WBC world champion Fury in a non-title bout.The Cameroonian-French fighter almost delivered an upset when he dropped Fury to the canvas with a left hook in that fight.\u201cI feel confident enough, based on my training, the hard work that I put in,\u201d Ngannou said in his pre-fight press conference on Wednesday.\u201cIt [fight against Fury] was a good experience and it definitely guided me better to have proper training.\u201cEvery space I have open, I am going to hit \u2026 I am not going to leave any stone unturned and any opportunity unexplored.\u201dMuch of the pre-fight narrative is presuming a win for Joshua that would put him in line to fight Fury, provided Fury \u2013 the WBC champion \u2013 beats Oleksandr Usyk \u2013 the WBA, IBF and WBO champion \u2013 in their rearranged May 18 bout that will crown the first undisputed heavyweight champion since 2000.Ngannou is ready to make more headlines in his fast-track bid to become a boxing champion so soon after dominating the UFC scene.\u201cI\u2019ve exposed myself \u2013 the guy who is coming next time [Joshua] knows what to deal with,\u201d Ngannou said after arriving in Riyadh.\u201cI\u2019ve lost that element of surprise. So how can I surprise him again? What can I pull from my sleeve once again?\u201dNgannou, who has a 17-3 mixed martial arts record with 12 victories by knockout, will once again be the underdog when he faces two-time world heavyweight champion Joshua, but the Briton said he would not make the mistake of underestimating his less-experienced opponent.\u201cHe\u2019s been boxing. His first dream was to be a boxer, which people forget. He was part of the Cameroonian team,\u201d Joshua told reporters.\u201cI know what I am up against, I look at all of these small details.

He was paid $10m for his night\u2019s work, a windfall which has helped the once shoeless Cameroonian buy a luxurious home in Las Vegas.On Friday, Ngannou will return to Riyadh to face 34-year-old Joshua whose career could take a big blow if he loses.\u201cOf course I can knock Joshua out,\u201d said Ngannou. \u201cI believe if I land on anyone, I will knock them out. The question is how to land. That\u2019s the hardest thing.\u201dJoshua, a former unified WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight champion, comes into the fight on the back of three successive wins.Before that, however, he lost back-to-back fights with Oleksandr Usyk who will fight Fury for the undisputed heavyweight title in Saudi in May.\u201cThis Friday it\u2019s going to go down, so I can\u2019t wait for the opportunity to show my skills and combat this person who thinks he can knock me out,\u201d Joshua said of Ngannou.\u201cI believe I can knock him out. Definitely.

        "Senegal will hold its\u00a0delayed presidential election on March 24, the government has said, following weeks of political turmoil and violent protests calling for an immediate vote.The announcement on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting followed a February ruling in which the country\u2019s top court declared that outgoing President Macky Sall\u2019s plans to hold the vote after his term expires on April 2 were unconstitutional.Sall also dissolved the government on Wednesday, replacing Prime Minister Amadou Ba with Interior Minister Sidiki Kaba. The presidency said that change would help Ba, who is the ruling coalition\u2019s presidential candidate, focus on his electoral campaign.It is the latest twist in a charged Senegal where Sall\u2019s decision to delay elections originally set for February 25, citing errors in the electoral process, led to violent unrest, and warnings from the country\u2019s international allies that its reputation as one of coup-hit West Africa\u2019s more stable democracies is under threat.The crisis had prompted an emergency meeting of the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc in an attempt to calm widespread violence.The Constitutional Council had in February ruled that a proposal from a national dialogue commission for the vote to be held on June 2 was not in line with the constitution.\u201cThe Council\u2019s decision to stand up to the president \u2026 is seen as a tribute to Senegalese democracy, and the new election date comes as a relief to many Senegalese who will finally have a say in their country\u2019s future,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Nicolas Haque reported from the capital, Dakar.Sall had cited concerns about electoral disputes for his move to delay the vote, but opposition parties said it amounted to an attempted institutional coup.Opposition presidential candidate Anta Babacar, who was among the majority of the 19 contenders in the race pushing for the vote to be held as soon as possible, welcomed the announcement.\u201cAt the end of the day, the question is why did he postpone it in the first place?\u201d Babacar told Al Jazeera. \u201cHe talked about an institutional crisis, [but] today we have the proof that Senegal is in no form of crisis.\u201dParliament on Wednesday additionally approved an amnesty law proposed by Sall in an attempt to ease tensions as he navigates a tense standoff with the opposition.The law would see hundreds of protesters and opposition members pardoned after they were accused of crimes relating to antigovernment protests in the last three years.However, opposition members and rights groups warn the policy could also let security forces off the hook for excessive, and at times deadly, use of force against protesters in recent months that has seen dozens killed.Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday that the draft law \u201copens the door to impunity for serious crimes\u201d, and noted that at least 40 people have been killed during violent clashes since March 2021 with no accountability.According to the opposition and civil society groups, up to 1,000 opposition members, including party leaders and presidential candidates, journalists, and activists were arrested across the country between March 2021 and January 2023, HRW said. Also among them are top opposition leader Ousmane Sonko.Much of the political unrest was triggered by concerns that Sall was trying to silence his opponents and hold onto power past the end of his mandate, allegations he has denied.\u201cIt is a denial of the right to truth, justice and transparency,\u201d Ousmane Diallo of Amnesty International told Al Jazeera. \u201cSaying that an amnesty law will be voted in Senegal after saying for three years that investigations have been going on, the killing of more than 60 people and the detentions of a thousand people, it\u2019s a denial of justice.\u201dA new round of protests broke in February after Sall announced the plan to postpone the elections.",
        "Gelang Patah, Malaysia \u2013 On an overcast morning six years ago, Mohammad Ridhwan Mohd Yazid was on his way back to Malaysia\u2019s southern Johor coast when his small fishing boat was caught in a sudden storm.In a matter of minutes, the calm southerly March winds transformed into gales whipping up high seas that slammed into his boat, knocking both him and the day\u2019s catch into the air.Alone and about a kilometre (about half a mile) from Singapore\u2019s northwestern shore, Ridhwan landed back on the boat near its engine and turned quickly for land.\u201cI didn\u2019t care that I lost half of what I caught that day. I just wanted to go home,\u201d the 30-year-old told Al Jazeera in an interview at the coastal jetty in Pendas, a fishing village in Malaysia\u2019s southern state of Johor.Ridhwan\u2019s tale is not an isolated one, but shared by many traditional Malaysian fishermen who have found themselves increasingly affected by the climate crisis, which is changing weather patterns that have long governed when and where they can fish.Such fishermen are estimated to make up about 65 percent of Malaysia\u2019s total fishing community, and are small-scale operators from seaside or river communities and ply waters close to shore or along the river for fish, clams, crabs and other marine animals to meet local demand.They typically use single-engine boats about seven metres (23 feet) long, casting their nets in an area up to five nautical miles (9.3km) from the shore along the country\u2019s more than 4,600km (2,858 miles) of coastline.But erratic weather, warming seas and declining fish stocks caused by climate change are slowly pushing them away from the seas they and generations before them once depended on.\u201cIn the past, we didn\u2019t have to go far to get a good catch. We could just go near the shore,\u201d said Mohd Hafiza Abu Talib.Now, he said, winds could shift direction without warning, treacherous for those who usually work alone or fish at night.\u201cThe winds can suddenly change and bring us somewhere else. It\u2019s even worse when we fish in the dark, and we don\u2019t have GPS,\u201d the man in his late 40s\u00a0added.Studies by the United Nations have shown that oceans absorb 25 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions and capture 90 percent of the heat generated by these emissions trapped in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.The US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed a daily sea surface temperature of 21 degrees Celsius (69.8 Fahrenheit) from early January, one degree more than during the same period 30 years ago.Man-made emissions have pushed the average temperature of oceans higher, leading to the melting of polar ice, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, marine heatwaves and more fiercely unpredictable weather.Mangroves have also been damaged, and coral reefs, where fish breed, have bleached.Professor Mohd Fadzil Mohd Akhir, an oceanographer with Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, said marine animals, sensitive to sea temperatures, had been found to migrate to cooler waters as oceans warmed.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that when the climate gets warmer, that fish is not available anywhere,\u201d he said.\u201cMost marine organisms in tropical areas will move to cooler areas when these areas get warmer.\u201dA 2022 University of British Columbia study found that climate change would force 45 percent of fish that cross through two or more exclusive economic zones to move away from their natural habitats by the end of the century.An exclusive economic zone (EEZ) refers to an area of ocean or sea that extends some 200 nautical miles (370km) beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters.The prospect of a further decline in an already falling harvest is a huge blow for Malaysia\u2019s coastal fishermen who have invested thousands in a back-breaking trade with often poor returns.A single boat can cost about 14,000 Malaysian ringgit ($2,928) with thousands more needed for nets, engines and fuel.A Pendas fisherman can potentially net upwards of about 300 ringgit ($62) of fish or crabs from the sea on a good day, and more during certain seasons. However, fishermen who have fished here for decades complain that there are fewer good days than before.\u201cI used to be able to get 30 to 40kg [66 to 88lbs] of crabs in a day,\u201d said Shafiee Rahmat, 63, who has been fishing for 50 years.\u201cNow I get about 10kg [22lbs] in a day. It\u2019s just not worth it.\u201dOriginally, fishermen in the area blamed the dwindling supply on coastal and industrial developments.Chief among the complaints was the construction of the artificial islands making up the 2,833-hectare (7,000 acres) China-backed Forest City property project, some 20km (12 miles) from Pendas.But Serina Rahman, a conservation scientist working with fishermen in the area for more than 15 years, also noticed a \u201cdramatic collapse\u201d as the world shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cWe always thought it was development that was affecting the fish catch,\u201d the lecturer from the National University of Singapore said.However, Serina and the fishermen noticed that fish stocks did not climb back as hoped, even as coastal development, previously blamed for declining catches, came to a halt during the lockdowns.She said that while dredging in the past had been shown to increase the catch of certain species, such as prawns, climate change had no such benefits.\u201cThat was when we really saw the fall in catch, because over the COVID period was when we saw the numbers totally decline,\u201d\u00a0Serina said.Spurred by the diminishing supply and extreme weather, some fishermen from Pendas have banded together with help from a local environmental group to build an offshore fishing platform to earn more money.Colloquially referred to as \u201ckelong\u201d or \u201crafts\u201d, the floating wooden structures serve as controlled aquaculture breeding grounds and spots for visiting anglers.Potentially, each platform can net up to 100,000 ringgit ($20,920) a year in fish; a lot less risky than going out to sea.Ridhwan said that there were \u201cmany\u201d now skirting the Johor coast, compared with only three or four a decade ago.Fed up with the unrewarding waters, he has taken several breaks from the trade over the past 10 years, working odd jobs including as a delivery courier during the pandemic.He finally called it quits two years ago and sold his boat. Today, Ridhwan does diving work as well as sometimes maintaining the Pendas fishermen\u2019s platform and feeding the fish they farm.\u201cEveryone here wants to be a fisherman,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s not good for us, what\u2019s the point? We have to change with the times.\u201d",
        "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made his first official visit to the main city of Indian-administrated Kashmir since New Delhi scrapped the disputed region\u2019s semi-autonomy in 2019.Addressing a crowd in a football stadium in Srinagar, Modi on Thursday announced development projects and said previous governments had misled people over the region\u2019s special status.Modi\u2019s government stripped the Muslim-majority territory of its special constitutional status, splitting the former state into two territories \u2013 Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 directly ruled from New Delhi. Inherited protections on land and jobs given to the Indigenous residents were also removed.The move, widely welcomed across India, angered many in the densely militarised territory. Rebels in the Himalayan region have waged a rebellion since 1989, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan, which controls a smaller part of the Kashmir region and, like India, claims it in full.\u201cThe success story of Jammu and Kashmir will be the centre of attraction for the world,\u201d he said, adding the region has prospered since the 2019 move.\u201cThis new Jammu-Kashmir has the courage to overcome any challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country is seeing these smiling faces of yours \u2026 [and] feeling relieved to see you all happy.\u201dAlthough Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not a key player in Kashmir, the visit is seen as a signal to its voters that the party has fulfilled a core promise to end Kashmir\u2019s special status.Thursday\u2019s event was also a part of Modi\u2019s campaign ahead of national election scheduled in April and May, the first since the region lost its autonomy. The last election for the region\u2019s legislative assembly was held in 2014, but the government was dismissed in 2018.Modi did not mention plans to hold elections in the region or to restore its statehood, both demanded by Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s pro-India political parties. His close aide and federal Home Minister Amit Shah has repeatedly promised that the region would be regain statehood after elections.In December, India\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the 2019 decision and asked the government to conduct state polls by September.Modi\u2019s government claims New Delhi\u2019s direct rule of Kashmir brought about a new era of \u201cpeace and development\u201d in the region, but critics and many residents say it heralded a drastic curtailment of civil liberties and press freedom.For security, thousands of armed police and paramilitary forces in flak jackets were deployed, and new checkpoints were set up across Srinagar. The forces laid razor wire as they patrolled all the roads leading to the football stadium and randomly frisked residents and searched vehicles.Navy commandos in motorboats patrolled the Jhelum river that snakes through the city. Most schools in the city are shut for the day, and the authorities have called on government employees to attend the rally.Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, accused the government of organising buses to bring in crowds to attend the rally, alleging that \u201calmost none\u201d would be attending willingly.\u201cThis visit is only meant to \u2026 drum up support amongst the BJP\u2019s core constituency in the rest of India for the upcoming parliament elections,\u201d Mehbooba Mufti, another former chief minister and former BJP ally, posted on social network X.",
        "Islamabad, Pakistan \u2014 It is the latest setback for former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.On Monday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) declared that the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) could not claim allocated reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.PTI, unable to contest recent elections due to a ban on their electoral symbol, instructed its candidates to join the right-wing fringe religious party in order to extend their numerical strength in the National Assembly.In its 22-page judgment issued on Monday, the five-member electoral body decided 4-1 that the SIC failed to submit a party list for reserved candidates before the ECP\u2019s deadline of February 22, two weeks after the February 8 election.Pakistan\u2019s National Assembly has a total of 70 reserved seats which are distributed among parties based upon their performance in the general elections. Similarly, the four provincial assemblies have a combined total of 149 reserved seats that are similarly distributed.A majority of these reserved seats have already been allocated \u2014 around 77 remain vacant, for now.PTI has criticised the ECP judgement, calling it an attack on democracy.\u201cThis is the last assault on the heart of democracy,\u201d Senator Ali Zafar of PTI, and a senior party lawyer said during a speech in the Senate, the upper house of the assembly on Monday after the decision was announced.The ECP\u2019s decision opens the door for a prolonged legal battle, as PTI has announced it will challenge the decision in higher courts.However, if the party fails to overturn it, it could further dent its position in the lower house of parliament, potentially allowing the ruling coalition to gain a two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly.Pakistan\u2019s general elections for the National Assembly take place on 266 seats. But there are an additional 70 reserved seats (60 for women and 10 for minorities) which give the body a total size of 336 seats.To achieve a simple majority to form a government, a total of 169 seats is required. However, a two-thirds majority \u2014 or 224 votes \u2014 is necessary to make any constitutional amendments.Reserved seats are allocated only to political parties that win seats in the National Assembly, and the distribution is done based on their proportional representation after the general elections. Similarly, reserved seats are allocated in provincial assemblies based on the parties\u2019 proportionate performances.According to regulations, any political party contesting the polls must submit a list of their nominations for reserved seats prior to elections, as per the schedule given by the ECP. However, after the polls, if a party has over-performed and needs to submit additional names for reserved candidates, it has two weeks to do so.Independents have three days after their win announcement to declare their affiliation with a party in the assembly.The party they join gets a boost in the number of reserved seats it gets, commensurate with the number of independents that join it.In the National Assembly, the ECP has already allocated at least 40 out of 60 seats to different political parties for their reserved quota for women. Similarly, seven out of 10 seats reserved for the minorities quota have already been allocated in the lower house of the parliament. The rest are currently vacant.Forced to contest the recent general elections on February 8 without its party symbol \u2013 the cricket bat \u2013 due to violating election rules, PTI fielded candidates as independents.Despite facing a nationwide crackdown for nearly two years, with its leader, former Prime Minister Imran Khan, imprisoned since August last year, and its candidates unable to campaign freely, PTI still emerged as the single largest bloc, with its candidates winning 93 seats.While the party claimed widespread rigging across the country and alleged a \u201cstolen mandate\u201d, its rivals, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP), managed to cobble together a ruling alliance, with 75 and 54 seats respectively, in coalition with other smaller parties.Even though they won the most seats, the PTI leadership, under orders from Imran Khan, decided not to form a government with any of the major parties and instead joined hands with a fringe, right-wing religious party, the SIC, to claim reserved seats.Complicating matters further was the fact that the SIC, despite being a registered political party, did not contest the general elections. Its leader, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, chose to contest independently, winning his seat from Faisalabad city in Punjab province.In its verdict, the ECP stated that the SIC was not entitled to claim the quota for reserved seats due to a \u201cviolation of a mandatory provision of submitting a party list for reserved seats, which is a legal requirement\u201d.It also said that the currently vacant seats in the national assembly \u2014 23 \u2014 \u201cwill not\u201d remain vacant and will be distributed among other parties based on the elected seats they won.The commission criticised the SIC by reminding them that they were given a specific timeframe to submit a list of nominations, which the party did not.\u201cEvery political party, while making any decision regarding crucial steps concerning matters of the political party required under law, should be aware of the potential consequences they may face in the future,\u201d the ECP wrote.On March 3, Shehbaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) was elected the country\u2019s new prime minister by the National Assembly, securing 201 votes. Omar Ayub Khan, the PTI leader backed by the SIC, managed to secure 92 votes.The biggest beneficiary of the ECP decision will be Sharif\u2019s PMLN, along with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which won the most number of seats in the general elections, with 75, 54 and 17 respectively.In case PTI\u2019s legal challenge fails to bring them any relief, it is a certainty that the ruling coalition will cross the magic figure of 224, which is required to achieve a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.However, if PTI manages to get the ECP decision reversed, it can expect to get 23 further seats in the National Assembly, in addition to extra seats in other provincial assemblies where they have done well. That might limit the governing coalition to just below the two-thirds mark.The ECP decision has been widely criticised by lawyers, with many calling the order a \u201cfarce\u201d or even \u201cunconstitutional\u201d.Constitutional expert Asad Rahim says the ECP verdict aligns with its previous decisions that, he alleged, have disenfranchised the people of Pakistan.\u201cThere are precedents expressly barring the minor technicalities on the basis of which the ECP barred the largest party,\u201d the Lahore-based lawyer told Al Jazeera. \u201cHowever, an even greater subversion of the democratic mandate is its division of the remaining seats among the smaller parties.\u201dAnother legal expert, Rida Hosain, also questioned the decision to distribute the unallocated seats to other, smaller parties. She argued that no legal or constitutional provision permitted this \u201cabsurd\u201d distribution.\u201cThe entire framework of the Constitution and law dictates that a political party should receive reserved seats through a system of proportional representation. It is entirely undemocratic for other political parties to get a share of reserved seats beyond their proportional strength of general seats in the National Assembly,\u201d Hosain told Al Jazeera.Islamabad-based lawyer Salaar Khan also noted that the ECP decision lacks any \u201cconvincing justification\u201d for allocating the unallocated seats to other parties.\u201cHowever, the impact may well be granting the coalition government a full two-thirds majority in the National Assembly,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.On the other hand, lawyer Mian Dawood argued that the SIC was clearly at fault for failing to submit their list within the deadline.\u201cThis is the first instance where a political party like the SIC has not submitted its list for reserved seats as required by law, yet now demands them on grounds of morality and the law of necessity,\u201d Dawood told Al Jazeera.Abdul Moiz Jaferii, a constitutional expert and lawyer, viewed the ECP verdict as another \u201ctechnical knockout\u201d suffered by PTI.\u201cThe PTI perhaps themselves opened the door to this by not standing their ground with the ECP regarding their own reserved seat lists and maintaining that they are still a political party, albeit without a symbol,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.Lawyers also expressed pessimism regarding PTI receiving any favourable verdict from the superior courts.\u201cThe PTI seems to have decided to challenge the decision before the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of election laws is, of course, what landed the PTI here to begin with,\u201d lawyer Khan said, referring to the Supreme Court verdict in January this year upholding the ECP decision to strip the party of its cricket bat symbol.",
        "Massive industrial action has paralysed air and rail travel across Germany as striking workers walked off the job to demand better pay to cope with the rising cost of living.Thursday\u2019s walkouts by the train drivers coincided with a strike by ground staff at national airline Lufthansa that led to mass flight cancellations at Germany\u2019s busiest airports, including main hub Frankfurt.The rail strike is due to last until Friday, Germany\u2019s train union head Claus Weselsky said. \u201cWith this, we begin a so-called strike wave,\u201d he told reporters.Reporting from an empty Berlin Central Station, Al Jazeera\u2019s Dominic Kane said there were no subregional trains moving at all, with only a few cross-country ones still active.\u201cIt\u2019s a similar picture right around the country,\u201d Kane said.Overall, about 80 percent of all long-distance trains, as well as regional and commuter trains in the country, were cancelled, leading to traffic jams in the streets and employees struggling to arrive on time for work.The simultaneous action is the latest in a recent series of strikes hitting Germany\u2019s travel sector in the past year, a result of high inflation and worker shortages.It comes as the economic institute DIW Berlin warned that the German economy was not picking up as quickly as expected, forecasting a recession at the start of the year.Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by 0.1 percent in the first quarter, according to DIW, after the economy shrank by 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2023. A technical recession is commonly defined as back-to-back quarters of contracting GDP.The German train drivers\u2019 union (GDL) demands that national train operator Deutsche Bahn reduce workers\u2019 weekly hours from 38 to 35 hours at full pay to help offset lofty inflation and staff shortages.The action comes after weeks-long talks between the two parties broke down last week. An earlier strike in late January, one of the longest in the state-owned company\u2019s 30-year history, ended prematurely as an economic slowdown led to pressure on GDL to return to the negotiating table.Meanwhile, Lufthansa is also locked in disputes with worker\u2019s union Verdi over pay. The union is demanding a 12.5 percent increase in pay over a year for the airline\u2019s staff, as well as a one-off 3,000 euros ($3,268) bonus.Frankfurt airport, Germany\u2019s busiest, was forced to cancel scheduled departures due to the strike, which will last until Saturday morning.\u201cFraport is asking all passengers starting their journey in Frankfurt not to come to the airport on March 7 and to contact their airline,\u201d the airport\u2019s operator said in a statement on Wednesday.The ADV airport association warned that strikes in the aviation sector, which also took place in Hamburg and Duesseldorf, were damaging Germany\u2019s reputation as a centre for business and tourism.",
        "Russian President Vladimir Putin is all but certain to win his fifth election.But according to the 2020 constitutional amendment that \u201cnullified\u201d his previous terms, the March 15-17 election is going to be his \u201cfirst\u201d.Putin announced his candidacy in December during a choreographed ceremony in a lavishly decorated Kremlin hall when talking to a separatist \u201ccolonel\u201d from the southeastern Ukrainian region of Donbas.\u201cOn behalf of all of our people, our Donbas, the lands that reunited [with Russia], I wanted to ask you to take part in this election,\u201d Artyom Zhoga, clad in an impeccable uniform adorned with medals, told Putin.\u201cI\u2019m not going to hide it, I\u2019ve had different thoughts at different times, but now is the time to make a decision, and I will run,\u201d poker-faced Putin replied.He has served four. He was elected president in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, 2012, and 2018.If he wins, as expected, he will serve another six years, thanks to constitutional amendments that have expanded the term. This would mark his fifth term.He can then be re-elected again in 2030 for a sixth term.That means he could be in power until 2036, when he will be 83 years old.The 71-year-old ex-KGB spy is already Russia\u2019s longest-serving leader since Soviet leader Josef Stalin.Putin\u2019s increasingly iron-fisted treatment of opposition, critics and antiwar protesters has been widely compared with Stalin\u2019s \u201cbig terror\u201d campaigns.But to Kremlin loyalists, Putin is a political \u201cgenius\u201d who prevented Russia\u2019s disintegration, reigned in billionaire oligarchs and subdued Chechen separatists.Putin\u2019s supporters also call him a \u201cgatherer of Russian lands\u201d, an honourable sobriquet for Russian princes and czars, for waging the 2008 war on ex-Soviet Georgia, recognising two breakaway Georgian statelets, annexing Crimea in 2014 and parts of four more Ukrainian regions in 2022.On February 16, Alexey Navalny, Putin\u2019s most outspoken political opponent, died in an Arctic prison in what his family, supporters, and much of the international community claimed was political murder.Navalny was denied registration in the 2018 presidential election that Putin won with almost 78 percent of the vote.Two more opposition figures \u2013 Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kaza-Murza \u2013 have been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years and 25 years in jail, respectively, for their criticism of Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.Thousands more \u2013 opposition figures, critics and average Russians who posted an antiwar comment online or simply liked or shared one \u2013 have faced criminal charges.Tens of thousands have been arrested, fined or forced out of the country.In addition, at least a million Russian men fled after the war, especially following the September 2022 announcement of \u201cmobilisation\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to do with this farce. They wanted me to die, they wanted my son to be an orphan,\u201d Demyan, a 32-year-old web designer who fled to Georgia and then to southern Portugal in late 2022, told Al Jazeera.Authorities largely do not prevent their exodus. But they adopted a law allowing confiscation of their property for \u201ccriticising the special military operation\u201d, the Kremlin\u2019s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine.Some 79 percent of Russians intend to vote for Putin, according to a February survey by VTsIOM, a Kremlin-controlled pollster.Some everyday Russians await the vote with apathy and hopelessness after adapting to the wartime reality around them.\u201cEveryone seems to have gotten used to the situation, gave up or sometimes even began to gain from it,\u201d Mikhail, a freelance copywriter from a Moscow suburb, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe shock has been replaced with apathy and depression.\u201dThis is the first vote in Russian history that lasts three days instead of one. It is also the first time voters in 29 regions can vote online.Some 112 million people aged 18 and above in Russia are eligible to vote.People in annexed Crimea and occupied parts of Ukraine will also vote, a move Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned as illegitimate.Millions of Russian nationals living abroad \u2013 from the Russia-leased spaceport of Baikonur in southern Kazakhstan to California in the United States \u2013 can also vote in embassies, consulates or by mail.At least 61 percent of Russians are \u201cdefinitely\u201d taking part in the vote, according to a poll by FOM, a Kremlin-funded pollster, released on March 5.Another 16 percent are \u201clikely\u201d to cast their ballots, and only 9 percent will abstain from the vote, the poll said.Initial results are expected to be announced on March 19, with the final outcome to be revealed on March 29.The officially-expected turnout is nearly as high as during the 2018 vote, when almost 68 percent of Russians cast their ballots, according to official figures.In 2018, independent election monitors documented thousands of cases of vote rigging, including ballot stuffing and \u201ccarousels\u201d, when hundreds of voters are bussed to multiple polling stations.Some of the monitors faced threats and were denied access to polling stations.The vote was \u201coverly controlled\u201d and \u201clacked genuine competition\u201d, said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an international election observer. Authorities coerced government employees, servicemen and law enforcement officers to vote for Putin, it said.Observers who follow Russian politics have little hope the vote will be carried out in a free and fair manner.Putin is running as an independent candidate because the ruling United Russia party is widely seen as corrupt and inefficient.Late opposition leader Navalny dubbed it the \u201cparty of crooks and thieves\u201d.Other candidates are seen as figureheads whose participation is only supposed to show how \u201cpopular\u201d Putin is.One is Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party. He took part in the 2004 vote and finished a distant second.Another is Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). He has been accused of sexually harassing a journalist. Slutsky called the accusations part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d against him.Slutsky replaces Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant populist who ran against Putin four times and was widely compared with former United States President Donald Trump, as the LDPR presidential nominee. He died in 2020.And while the Communist and LDPR candidates are relatively known, the third registered candidate, Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, is obscure and barely known outside Moscow.All three are part of the \u201csystemic opposition\u201d, a handful of parties with a presence in the State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament.All three back the war in Ukraine and generally support the Kremlin party line.Between 2 percent and 4 percent of Russians are expected to vote for each of them, according to the VtsIOM poll.Liberal opposition candidate Boris Nadezhdin was denied registration because of allegedly \u201cinvalid\u201d signatures of support in his candidate application.Nadezhdin, who openly criticised the war in Ukraine, said he would recruit independent election monitors and has promised to keep fighting against the Supreme Court rulings against him. But there is no chance he will be able to run.He told Al Jazeera in early February that he was excluded \u201cbecause my election rating, the number of people who are ready to vote for me grows 5 percent a week\u201d.In the winter of 2011-12, some of the largest opposition rallies in Russia\u2019s post-Soviet victory took place after the parliamentary and presidential votes that were widely seen as rigged.The Kremlin responded with a massive crackdown. It now has more advanced tools to silence opposition \u2013 facial recognition software and mobile phone data to identify each protester.Any protests \u201cwill be disunited and badly organised\u201d, said Sergey Biziyukin, an opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan who was forced out of Russia after trying to register for the 2018 presidential vote.\u201cMost of the populace, irrespective of their attitude to Putin, the elections look staged,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.",
        "China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said China sees itself as a \u201cforce for peace\u201d in the world, even as it pursues deeper ties with Russia despite Moscow\u2019s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.\u201cIn the face of complex turmoil in the international environment, China will persist in being a force for peace, a force for stability, and a force for progress in the world,\u201d Wang told reporters at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, on the sidelines of the country\u2019s annual meeting of its parliament.Wang, who spoke in Mandarin, was also asked about China\u2019s relationship with Russia, which began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The two countries announced a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership shortly before the invasion, as Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing, and visiting Moscow last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed a \u201cnew era\u201d of cooperation.The foreign minister said Beijing and Moscow\u2019s closer relationship was a \u201cstrategic choice\u201d, noting that bilateral trade had reached a record $240bn in 2023.\u201cNew opportunities\u201d lay ahead, he added, portraying the two countries\u2019 ties as a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d in the relations between big powers.\u201cMajor countries should not seek conflict and the Cold War should not be allowed to come back,\u201d Wang said.China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and on the first anniversary of the conflict, released a 12-point peace plan calling for a ceasefire and talks between the two parties.On Thursday, Wang insisted that Beijing maintained an \u201cobjective and impartial position\u201d on Ukraine and called again for peace talks, noting that peace envoy Li Hui was currently in the region.\u201cA conflict, when prolonged, tends to deteriorate and escalate and could lead to an even bigger crisis,\u201d Wang said.During the wide-ranging discussion, which lasted for 90 minutes, 70-year-old Wang was also asked about issues including the conflict in Gaza, China\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the disputed South China Sea.The veteran diplomat called Israel\u2019s five-month-long war in Gaza and the world\u2019s apparent inability to stop the bloodshed, a \u201ctragedy for humanity and a disgrace for civilisation\u201d.Israel sent its forces into the territory after Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, launched an assault on Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people and kidnapping some 250 Israelis and foreigners.At least 30,717 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardments since amid a collapse in the health system and a growing risk of starvation. Hamas released some of the captives during a ceasefire in November but is thought to still be holding about 100 people.Urging the release of \u201call detainees\u201d, Wang called for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks.\u201cThe calamity in Gaza is a wakeup call for the world,\u201d he said.Talks brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the US to reach a six-week ceasefire ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough.Wang also reiterated China\u2019s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, saying it was the only way to achieve an end to the conflict.He also said China supported Palestine\u2019s \u201cfull\u201d membership of the United Nations.On relations with the US, which recovered some equilibrium late last year after the countries\u2019 two presidents met in San Francisco, Wang struck a note of optimism even as he lashed out at Washington for sanctions that he said had reached a \u201cbewildering level of unfathomable absurdity\u201d.Noting the US and China were due to mark 45 years of formal bilateral ties this year, Wang said China wanted relations that were \u201cstable and consistent\u201d and that Washington could work with Beijing on the basis of \u201cmutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.\u201dThe two sides have been at odds over a range of issues from Taiwan to trade and an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down after crossing into the US last year.Wang reiterated China\u2019s claim over Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing maintains is part of its territory, and said those who sought independence would be \u201cliquidated by history\u201d.He also had sharp warnings over the disputed South China Sea where China, which claims almost the entire sea despite an international tribunal ruling it without merit, has been involved in multiple confrontations with the Philippines in recent months.In the latest incident on Tuesday, the Philippines said its boat was damaged by a Chinese coastguard ship that tried to block a resupply mission to the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, which lies about 200km (124 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan and more than 1,000km (621 miles) from China\u2019s southern Hainan Island.Manila has moved closer to the US amid the growing tension in the strategic waters where China also deploys a maritime militia and its fishing fleet.Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also claim the parts of the South China Sea around their coasts.\u201cWe resolutely oppose all acts of hegemony and bullying, and will strongly uphold national sovereignty and security as well as development interests,\u201d Wang said.",
        "Deir el-Balah, Gaza \u2013\u00a0On a cold night three weeks ago, Aida al-Baawi rushed from the makeshift tent she had made home to the town\u2019s nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and, amid the ongoing war, gave birth to her daughter.The birth was a struggle because of a shortage of medical staff to care for her and not enough anaesthesia to mask the pain of receiving stitches.Her baby girl was born healthy, and a whole new struggle started for 29-year-old al-Baawi as she started searching endlessly for a necessity many mothers take for granted: nappies.Securing nappies has become al-Baawi\u2019s most daunting challenge, like many mothers in Gaza, as prices skyrocket for the items made scarce by the siege imposed by Israel.\u201cEvery day is a struggle to afford nappies for my baby girl, especially with another child who still needs them,\u201d the mother of four told Al Jazeera.For al-Baawi to buy two packs of nappies before the war would have cost less than $10, but that is no longer the case.\u201cImagine needing $75 to $80 just for nappies,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a sustainable situation?\u201dAl-Baawi has had to turn to other solutions. Sometimes she heads to the nursery of a nearby hospital, hoping that they will have some to spare.Other times she dries used nappies in the sun, hoping to reuse them despite the hygiene implications.And sometimes she is forced to leave her baby in her soiled nappy until she can get more, which inevitably takes a toll on the baby\u2019s delicate skin.But every cent al-Baawi spends on nappies is a cent less for other necessities. \u201cIf nappies are this expensive, how can I afford any other supplies? My children and I have only eaten one meal since yesterday evening.\u201dNeedless to say, where nappies are scarce, baby formula will be too.Nariman Abu al-Saud gave birth to a daughter on October 9, two days after the war began.\u201cAt the current prices, I can\u2019t even buy food for my children,\u201d she said.\u201cMy baby daughter gets awful skin infections because I can\u2019t get nappies,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no baby formula even.\u201d\u201cProviding milk and nappies has become hell for us.\u201cThis war is a war on our children and their lives. What did they do to have to endure such conditions?\u201dWith the vast majority of Gaza\u2019s population displaced and desperately needed aid only trickling in, health officials have reported that 20 people in the enclave have died from malnutrition and dehydration.The World Food Programme said on Tuesday that Israel must allow road access to northern Gaza to avoid famine, highlighting how desperate the situation is.People have been driven to trying alternatives for the scarce nappies.Local factories are making nappy substitutes using available raw materials, such as tissue paper, medical cotton batting, cloth and nylon.Yousef Darwish, a worker making nappies, explained that the price of locally made nappies is similar to the pre-war price.\u201cThere is a lot of demand from families even though these nappies are not as good \u2026 and are not manufactured according to health specifications,\u201d Darwish said.But even this alternative may not last as raw materials are dwindling, Darwish pointed out.\u201cWe\u2019re depleting our existing supplies, and with border closures since the war\u2019s outbreak, these resources are on the verge of running out,\u201d he said, referring to the severe limits on the entry of aid to Gaza imposed by Israel.\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for solutions from scratch in Gaza. But how much longer can mothers and children endure the scarcity and inflated prices of nappies? The situation has become unbearable.\u201dShaima Shinar, who gave birth to her first child during the war, has also had to turn to alternatives. Her mother-in-law is cutting up clothes to turn them into nappies.\u201cI have no choice. It is not easy because the fabric isn\u2019t comfortable, it causes skin irritations and abrasions,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cI also need to wash it constantly. As you can see, we live in a tent and there\u2019s no water.\u201dShinar fled from Gaza City to Deir el-Balah to escape the fighting. She had been on a short visit to Egypt only two weeks before the conflict began, not knowing that the timing of her return would be disastrous for herself and her then-unborn child.\u201cI never imagined in my life that my child would be born in such conditions,\u201d Shinar said. \u201cHow can I not be able to provide nappies for my child? Not be able to put him in a clean bed and a clean place instead of this cold tent?\u201d\u201cMy child is suffering in all aspects,\u201d she added. \u201cCurrently, he has a cold and I can\u2019t buy medicine, and there are no clothes or nappies.\u201dThe new mother explained that she often wanders between institutions looking for any assistance but to no avail.\u201cYesterday, my baby ran out of milk. I went to one of the tents to get two spoons of milk to satisfy his hunger.\u201cWe, the adults, can bear it, but what about the children?\u201d",
        "Rubymar, the Belize-flagged, British-owned cargo ship that was badly damaged in a Houthi attack in February, has almost completely sunk into the Red Sea, causing an oil slick and prompting serious concerns about environmental damage to the surrounding waters and their coral reefs.Here\u2019s a look at the sort of damage the Rubymar might cause:The ship was hit by anti-ship ballistic missiles launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels on February 18 while it was sailing through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The crew escaped the ship, evacuating to safety when the attack began. The Houthis have said they will target any ships in this area that are linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom to pressure them to end Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, and they claimed the attack.Early on Saturday, the US military\u2019s Central Command (CENTCOM) released an image of the vessel on its side in the water. A CENTCOM post on the social media platform X stated that the Rubymar had gone under the surface of the water at 2:15am on Saturday (23:15 GMT on Friday).Sinking of Motor Vessel\u2070Rubymar Risks Environmental\u2070DamageOn Mar. 2 at approximately 2:15 a.m., MV Rubymar, a Belize-flagged, UK-owned bulk carrier, sank in the Red Sea after being struck by an Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist anti-ship ballistic missile on Feb. 18.The ship\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fRUM4ll4cY\u2014 U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) March 3, 2024Rubymar is the first vessel to be sunk in the Red Sea since the Houthis began targeting commercial vessels in November.Satellite images show that the Rubymar has been leaking oil into the sea for weeks, ever since its engine room was damaged in the assault.\u201cThis ongoing leakage poses a threat to marine life, given the toxic nature of oil,\u201d Julien Jreissati, programme director for Greenpeace MENA (Middle East-North Africa), told Al Jazeera. Oil spills can also make seafood unsafe to eat.Oil spills are especially damaging to coral reefs and can impede \u201ccoral reproduction, growth, behaviour and development\u201d, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.The Rubymar is also believed to be carrying more than 41,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, Greenpeace MENA said. \u201cWe have no information on whether the fertiliser cargo is leaking into the sea,\u201d Jreissati said.However, if the fertiliser is mixing with the water in the Red Sea, it could throw off the balance of the marine ecosystem, impacting multiple food chains that exist within it, according to a Greenpeace MENA statement published on Saturday.Excess amounts of fertiliser in the water can cause ammonia toxicity and can kill fish, according to an article by Environment Management Specialists at North Dakota State University. If fish die, the catch will be low for Yemeni fishermen, who have already suffered in recent years due to war in the country.The Greenpeace report added that various species of fish and the livelihoods of coastal communities could be detrimentally impacted.Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, the prime minister of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government, called the ship\u2019s sinking \u201can unprecedented environmental disaster\u201d. Bin Mubarak has long been viewed as an adversary of the Houthis.At the moment, a small portion of the ship is still visible above the surface of the water, indicating that it has not yet sunk to the seabed. \u201cThe tip of the Rubymar\u2019s bow seems to remain afloat, but this precarious situation could change swiftly,\u201d Jreissati said.Could the tip of the #Rubymar bow still be above surface? Any emergency operation would be much more complicated once the ship sinks to the bottom of the sea. Time is of the essence!#Yemen Credit: 2024 Planet Labs PBC pic.twitter.com/SpLjwLNDaM\u2014 Julien Jreissati \u2013 \u062c\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0635\u0627\u062a\u064a (@julienjr) March 5, 2024Therefore, he added, \u201cTime is of the essence.\u201d If the ship descends to the seabed, any emergency operations to salvage it would become complex, he explained. \u201cEvery passing moment heightens the risk to both the environment and potential rescue efforts.\u201dHe said swift action is imperative, adding that \u201can expert team is urgently required on-site to assess the extent of the damage and formulate a rescue strategy.\u201dHouthi revolutionary committee leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi posted on X that there is still a chance to prevent further damage if UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government act quickly to allow aid into Gaza. He stated they are responsible for the Rubymar attack because of their support for the war on Gaza.\u201cSunak has a chance to recover the Rubymar by allowing aid trucks into Gaza,\u201d he wrote, specifying that George Galloway, the rebel independent who opposes the war on Gaza and recently won a parliamentary seat in northern England, must sign a letter of guarantee. Al-Houthi did not elaborate on whether this meant the Houthis would allow a salvage operation to access that area of the sea.While global warming has caused the temperatures of the oceans to rise, damaging coral reefs worldwide, the reefs in the Red Sea are generally continuing to thrive. They are some of the only reefs in the world that might survive global warming, according to marine ecologists and biologists.The main threats to the Red Sea remain overtourism and any future oil spills.",
        "An Israeli tank crew \u201clikely\u201d opened machinegun fire on an identifiable group of journalists near the border with Lebanon who were also targetted by shelling, a new report has found.The report on the October 13 attack, published on Thursday by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and commissioned by Reuters, found that a tank 1.34km (0.83 miles) away in Israel fired two 120mm rounds at the reporters with a heavy machinegun in a nearly two-minute onslaught.One Reuters reporter was killed in the attack and six journalists were injured, including two from Al Jazeera.Audio picked up by an Al Jazeera video camera at the scene showed the reporters also came under fire from 0.50 calibre rounds of the type used by the Browning machineguns that can be mounted on Israel\u2019s Merkava tanks \u2013 likely from the same point as the tank, TNO revealed.\u201cIt is considered a likely scenario that a Merkava tank, after firing two tank rounds, also used its machinegun against the location of the journalists,\u201d TNO\u2019s report said.\u201cThe latter cannot be concluded with certainty as the direction and exact distance of [the machine gun] fire could not be established.\u201dThe journalists were filming cross-border shelling from a distance in an open area on a hill near the Lebanese village of Alma ash-Shaab when they came under fire.Al Jazeera cameraperson Elie Brakhia and reporter Carmen Joukhadar, and two other Reuters journalists were among the group.The first shell killed Reuters visuals journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, and severely wounded Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Christina Assi.Israel\u2019s military said it was investigating the attack but the results have not been made public.The journalists were deliberately targeted, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in an earlier report, although it did not attribute responsibility to Israel.\u201cTwo strikes in the same place in such a short space of time (just over 30 seconds), from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting,\u201d RSF said, citing preliminary results of an investigation based on video footage and ballistic analysis.Reacting to TNO\u2019s report, Reuters\u2019s editor-in-chief Alessandra Galloni condemned the attack on the journalists in a statement and called for an Israeli investigation.\u201cWe reiterate our calls on Israel to explain how this could have happened and to hold those responsible to account,\u201d she said.Ihtisham Hibatullah, Al Jazeera\u2019s manager of international communications, also urged the Israeli government to disclose the findings of its own investigation, adding that the \u201cincident strongly indicates intentional targeting, as confirmed by investigations, including by TNO\u201d.AFP global news director Phil Chetwynd said: \u201cIf reports of sustained machine gun fire are confirmed, this would add more weight to the theory that this was a targeted and deliberate attack.\u201dIsrael\u2019s war on Gaza is one of the deadliest on record for journalists, with more reporters killed in the first 10 weeks following October 7 than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).The group said this week it had \u201cfound multiple kinds of incidents of journalists being targeted while carrying out their work in Israel and the two Palestinian territories, Gaza and the West Bank\u201d.Al Jazeera cameraperson Samer Abudaqa was killed by an Israeli strike on December 15 while reporting at the Farhana school in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. He was left to\u00a0bleed to death as emergency workers were blocked by the Israeli military from reaching the site.Wael Dahdouh, the network\u2019s Gaza bureau chief who earlier lost his wife, son and daughter in a single attack, was also injured in the assault.In January, an Israeli missile hit a vehicle carrying Hamza Dahdouh, the eldest son of Wael Dahdouh in the western part of Khan Younis, killing him. Dahdouh was traveling with fellow journalist Mustafa Thuraya who was also killed.As of last month, at least 99 journalists \u2013 most of them Palestinian \u2013 have been killed since the start of the war on Gaza on October 7, according to the CPJ.",
        "Israel has generated \u201cfamine-like conditions\u201d in the Gaza Strip \u201cwhile obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response\u201d, according to a new report by humanitarian group Refugees International.The group\u2019s research in Egypt, Jordan and Israel revealed that Tel Aviv \u201cconsistently and groundlessly impeded aid operations within Gaza, blocked legitimate relief operations and resisted implementing measures that would genuinely enhance the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza\u201d.The report was based on interviews with dozens of government officials, humanitarian workers, and NGO staff engaged in on-the-ground aid efforts from the three countries.\u201cOur research makes clear that conditions inside of Gaza are apocalyptic,\u201d said the report released on Thursday.\u201cAfter five months of war, Palestinians are struggling to find adequate food, water, shelter, and basic medicine. Famine-level hunger is already widespread and worsening.\u201dRefugees International also said that Israel was \u201cdemonstrably failing to comply\u201d with legally binding provisional measures ordered on January 26 by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to facilitate the flow of aid and lessen humanitarian suffering in Gaza.In its defence to the ICJ, Israel argued it has actively eliminated bottlenecks and improved the entrance and distribution of aid in Gaza.The report revealed that Israeli authorities have \u201cerected unnecessary hurdles, complicated logistical processes, and an unpredictable vetting system, rendering the inspection regime overwhelmingly burdensome with layers of bureaucracy and inspection and limited working hours\u201d.While Israel claimed that it expanded capacity for aid delivery to Gaza, the average number of trucks delivered in February actually fell by 50 percent compared with the previous month, according to United Nations data cited in the report.Critical crossings like the northern Erez and Al-Muntar \u2013 known as Karni to Israelis \u2013 remain closed, impeding access to the north of Gaza.The report said Israel failed to comply with the terms of a National Security Memorandum (NSM-20) issued in February by United States President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that require countries receiving US security assistance to actively facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Gaza.Refugees International found that logistical issues within Egypt and Jordan are limiting the distribution of life-saving assistance to people in Gaza.The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, mainly intended for commercial deliveries, lacks the capacity to process the substantial amount of aid the Strip requires. Egyptian authorities have also sought to deter a large-scale humanitarian response in the northern Sinai, a military zone.The report found that Egypt responded to Israel\u2019s pressure to open its borders to Palestinian refugees by intensifying its oversight and regulation of access to the border area for aid agencies, as well as its monitoring of entry and exit of individuals to and from Gaza.The charities delivering aid to Gaza from Jordan\u2019s capital Amman told Refugees International that Israeli officials put in place \u201cdifficult obstacles\u201d that did not exist before and have yet to provide clear standard operating procedures to Jordanian authorities.New barriers, such as new inspection requirements, are also stalling aid at the Allenby Bridge crossing into Israel and the border crossing at Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom).The report called on the warring parties in Gaza to \u201cimmediately agree to a mutual ceasefire and release of all hostages\u201d as well as \u201cadhere to international humanitarian law and refrain from any action that threatens the rights, safety, and dignity of both Palestinian and Israeli civilians\u201d.The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent weeks trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release Israeli captives in return for a six-week ceasefire, the release of some Palestinian prisoners and more aid to Gaza.But three days of negotiations with Hamas this week over a ceasefire in Gaza have failed to achieve a breakthrough, less than a week before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan \u2013 the informal deadline for a deal.Refugees International also called for an end to attacks on civilians and infrastructure and for allowing the UN and aid agencies access to populations in need.Among other recommendations, it said Israel must refrain from \u201ca military offensive in Rafah, and other actions that could displace Palestinians further or otherwise worsen the humanitarian crisis\u201d.The Israeli military has been preparing for a long-threatened ground invasion in the southern Gaza border city of Rafah, where more than half of the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million population has been forcibly displaced.At least 30,800 Palestinians have been killed and 72,198 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel from the October 7 Hamas attacks stands at 1,139.",
        "Hebron, occupied West Bank \u2013 Ishaq Qafisheh steers his wheelchair around the Ibrahimi Mosque, resting his trusty crutch on his shoulder as he rolls along. That crutch has been a lifelong companion since he was struck with polio as a small child.The 60-year-old is going to open his tiny grocery shop for the day, one of a few that remained open in the courtyard after the Israeli military closed most of them following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 1994.It is more like a prison canteen than a grocery shop, Qafisheh says as he settles into his seat in the 12sq-metre space (129sq feet), but it provides some essential basics for people who live nearby, trapped by Israeli checkpoints hemming them in tightly.\u201cThe Palestinians who buy my groceries are prisoners, just like those in any prison. My only customers are the people who live inside the checkpoints,\u201d Qafisheh says.Qafisheh has worked in this shop for as long as he can remember.It used to be a falafel restaurant up until about 30 years ago when he decided to transform it into a small grocer, which would make it easier for him to work there.Now, he sells basic food items along with crowd-pleasers like sweets and chocolates, ice creams, snacks, carbonated drinks and juices.He lives upstairs from his shop with his wife and three children, one son and two daughters.His son Osama, 23, helps him receive deliveries, stock the shelves, and watch the shop. Osama finished high school and decided to work with his father, who has dedicated his life to this spot and this shop.\u201cI love seeing the Ibrahimi Mosque and its visitors,\u201d Qafisheh says. \u201cI love receiving my neighbours in my shop, catching up with them and their news. This shop has become \u2018the soul\u2019 of this area.\u201cMy grocery is my soul, and the Ibrahimi Mosque is my life,\u201d he continues. \u201cThis is where I was born and raised with my family, and I stayed despite many others leaving as a result of the occupation\u2019s policies and obstacles.\u201cBut I\u2019m staying, in my home and in my shop.\u201dAbout 68 families live within the Israeli military checkpoints around the Ibrahimi Mosque area \u2013 which lies within H2, an area under Israeli control in Hebron.This makes for a total of about 400 people unable to move outside the checkpoints, frozen in place by a curfew imposed by Israel since its war on Gaza began on October 7.There are more than 20 Israeli checkpoints, including gates, checkpoints, soldiers and more soldiers keeping them locked in, except for half an hour in the morning on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays when they can leave, and an hour during the evening on the same days when they are allowed to return.Movement was slightly easier before the war on Gaza began, before the curfew, but everyone living around the mosque still had to pass the checkpoints.For the first 130 days after October 7, Qafisheh remembers acutely, there were no shops allowed to open within the area enclosed by checkpoints, which meant everybody had to leave to buy the tiniest item, including Qafisheh.He would head out with his wife and son, Osama, to buy whatever they needed. Until finally he was allowed to reopen his own grocery shop, because it carried essentials and because his health condition made securing what he needed from beyond the checkpoints.He was overjoyed and immediately got to work dusting and washing down the shelves which had accumulated a thick layer of dust during the four months of closure \u2013 he had not been allowed out of his house to check on the shop.The next step was restocking, which required placing an order over the phone from a supplier who could only get as far as 300 metres (330 yards) from the outside of the checkpoints.Undeterred, Qafisheh wheeled himself out, accompanied by Osama, so they could receive and inspect everything and take it back through the checkpoints themselves.Getting stock back does not always go smoothly, and Qafisheh has lost ice creams and other refrigerated items when he got held up at checkpoints, sometimes for hours at a time.That Qafisheh is happy to be behind his shop counter is clear to everyone who sees him and his contented smile. Passers-by stop to greet him and exchange news about anything and everything.Business is a little slow, as the economic crisis that has everyone in the occupied West Bank in its grip means nobody has much cash to spend, but for Qafisheh, returning to his shop was a matter of his own sovereignty and that he will stay in his shop, no matter what.\u201cI can do it. I\u2019ve been through the closures and curfews. People were depressed, suffering, and lived in fear of settler attacks, especially during the night.\u201cHomes were stormed by the army most often while people were sleeping, and the settlers launched most of their attacks during that time too.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the settler attacks escalate all over the West Bank, around us, around where we live. And the army and settlers have imprisoned us in our homes.\u201dBut, he continues, he will keep doing what he does, and will try to expand the shop\u2019s offerings to include more basics that his neighbours need so much, especially as Ramadan approaches.",
        "Israel\u2019s plan to build thousands of new homes in the occupied West Bank is facing widespread condemnation from several countries, including some of Tel Aviv\u2019s staunchest allies.The country\u2019s settlement-planning authority on Wednesday greenlit permits for nearly 3,500 new illegal settlement housing units in the occupied Palestinian territory, the first such approval since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza began on October 7 last year.Israeli settlements have long been viewed as a violation of international law, and a hindrance to Palestinian statehood by the international community. Officials say the latest constructions, planned in Maale Adumim, Kedar and Efrat,\u00a0are in retaliation for a February shooting targeting illegal settlers.\u201cThe enemies try to harm and weaken us, but we will continue to build and be built up in this land,\u201d far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in charge of civil affairs in the West Bank, said on X.Smotrich said the constructions add to the 18,515 housing units in illegal settlements approved in the past year.The Palestinian Authority\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the settlements illegal and illegitimate, adding that they \u201care a call for the cycle of violence to persist\u201d.\u201cThe ministry calls for swift international sanctions that would deter Israel from building more settlements and to include [National Security Minister Itamar] Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as well as any other Israeli official who plays a role in deepening and funding illegal settlements,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.Hamas, the group that rules the Gaza Strip, has called Israel\u2019s move \u201ca confirmation of the Zionist plan aimed at controlling our land, restricting our people, and isolating them\u201d.\u201cWe affirm that this false declaration has no legal or legal basis, and is nothing but a message of defiance and recklessness,\u201d the group said in a statement, calling on the United Nations to take \u201cpunitive steps against this criminal entity and its Nazi leaders\u201d.Hamas also warned \u201cagainst remaining silent about [Israel\u2019s] violations that increase tension and escalation in the region\u201d.Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the settlements were unilateral and illegal measures that violate international law and undermine peace efforts and the establishment of a Palestinian state.Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also \u201ccondemned in the strongest terms\u201d the approval, stressing that such moves \u201cpose a serious threat to international efforts aimed at implementing the two-state solution and hinder the resumption of the peace process\u201d, according to state media.Similarly, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said there is a need to \u201cprovide hope for the Palestinian people, enable them to obtain their rights to live in safety, and establish their Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant international resolution\u201d.Further afield, in Europe, Germany has asked Israel to withdraw the plans, adding they are \u201ca serious violation of international law\u201d.\u201cWe strongly condemn the approval of further settlement units in the West Bank,\u201d the country\u2019s Federal Foreign Office said in a statement.Earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the plans were \u201cillegal, disappointing, and counterproductive to achieving enduring peace\u201d.\u201cOur administration maintains firm opposition to settlement expansion,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Argentina\u2019s capital Buenos Aires last week.\u201cIn our judgement, it only weakens, not strengthens Israel\u2019s security,\u201d he added, although he made no mention of tangible consequences Israel could face for settlement expansion.",
        "Anger following a French documentary on Tunisia shedding a light on what it called the \u201cpoverty and dictatorship\u201d of President Kais Saied\u2019s rule has continued to be directed towards participants in the film after the country\u2019s prime minister brought attention to the film last week.Prime Minister Ahmed Hachani\u2019s visit to Paris came a few days before the airing of Between Poverty and Dictatorship, the Great Step Backwards, by the French channel M6 on Sunday.Speaking alongside his French counterpart Gabriel Attal on Thursday, Hachani decided to devote most of his comments to the film, bringing far more attention to it in the North African country than the filmmakers perhaps expected.The film examined what it claimed were shrinking freedoms in Tunisia, the country\u2019s struggling economy and the conditions facing sub-Saharan African refugees and migrants who exist at the margins of Tunisian society.Hachani focused in his remarks on what he termed an \u201cunfriendly act by our French friends\u201d and said it was an attempt to insult Tunisia and harm bilateral relations between Tunis and Paris.The prime minister\u2019s inadvertent advertising has already led to more than 80,000 views on YouTube and a Tunisian media feverishly divided over the merits of the programme.Attacks have been particularly directed towards one of the interviewees featured in the documentary, essayist Hatem Nafti, who was critical of the Tunisian government.\u201cThe [furore has] been intense, and I\u2019m not sure when it\u2019s going to end,\u201d Nafti said of a response that has taken in everything from vicious online attacks to stalwart defences of his positions.\u201cThe thing is, I didn\u2019t say anything that was new or anything that hadn\u2019t been said before,\u201d he said.Much of the outrage, Nafti \u2013 who now lives in France \u2013 explained, stemmed not from anything he said, but that his comments were being heard by \u201cwhite people\u201d.\u201cTunisia\u2019s long had this thing where it measures its progress by the West,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to feel that we\u2019re accepted there and treated as equals.\u201dNafti pointed to online criticism over his comments on the hostile treatment afforded sub-Saharan refugees who were transiting through Tunisia without paperwork.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t attack the accuracy of what I\u2019d said, only that I\u2019d said it. Likewise, [they couldn\u2019t say anything about] the trials of the political prisoners arrested under Saied\u2019s rule, or the economy which continues to struggle,\u201d he said.Many of Tunisia\u2019s politicians, activists and critics of President Saied are currently serving prison sentences on charges ranging from corruption to plotting against state security, which political groups and human rights organisations say are falsely concocted by the government.Among those imprisoned, sentenced to two consecutive sentences on charges of incitement and receiving foreign financing, is one of Saied\u2019s sternest critics, the 82-year-old Rachid Ghannouchi, who has been on multiple hunger strikes since his incarceration.Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahdha, a self-styled \u2018Muslim Democrat\u2019 party, and the former speaker of parliament, has vigorously denied the accusations against him. Rights groups have accused Saied of repressing political opposition.\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, because [since the broadcast] I\u2019ve been attacked by both [political] Islamists because I said that Kais Saied ruled in the religious style of an Islamist, and those who say I\u2019m on the side of the Islamists because I defended the political prisoners,\u201d Nafti said. \u201cEqually, I\u2019ve been attacked for my comments on the treatment of the sub-Saharan [Africans]. Not because what I said was wrong, but because I said it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also been accused of being one of those token Arabs that many European channels use to tell their viewers that they\u2019re right and their country is wrong. That\u2019s just not true. I\u2019ve consistently opposed France\u2019s position on Gaza.\u201dIn February of last year, President Saied gave an incendiary speech, accusing the Black undocumented asylum seekers and refugees within Tunisia of being part of a \u201ccriminal plan to change the composition of the demographic landscape in Tunisia\u201d.A few months later, despite the tumult of racial violence the speech unleashed, the European Union signed a controversial pact on migration, with Tunisia accepting millions in aid and subsidies to \u201cimprove its border security\u201d and play an enhanced role in \u201chelping manage migration\u201d across the Mediterranean.\u201cOn the programme, I pointed to how immoral the migration pact the EU signed with Tunisia was, as well as how France\u2019s own role in deterring migration was fundamentally wrong,\u201d Nafti said.\u201cI think many people had hoped that all of this had gone away, since it stopped being reported,\u201d Hamza Meddeb, of the Carnegie Middle East Center, who is also based in France, said, referring to the government clampdown on critics within the media and the subsequent self-censorship of the press. \u201cNow, not only were they seeing it being reported, they were seeing it being reported in France.\u201dMeddeb continued, outlining the shock many of Saied\u2019s supporters may have felt on seeing their claims for the country systematically dismantled by a foreign media outlet. \u201cReally, they didn\u2019t say anything new. All their claims were measured and objective. There was nothing here but a mirror to a dirty reality.\u201d\u201cI think the reaction to this has highlighted two things,\u201d he said. \u201cFirstly, the absolute fragility of Saied\u2019s regime. It exposed what most people already knew, that they have no solution for the country. Secondly, the extent of the criticism has highlighted the extent of the growing anti-Western feeling in Tunisia.\u201dThat sentiment did not start with the war with Gaza, he caveated. It came before it, as unease grew over how unevenly the gains of the 2011 revolution had been distributed.However, since Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, \u201cthe West\u2019s claims to care about human rights and the rule of law have been shown up as untrue\u201d.And for now, there remains the fallout from a late-night documentary that few expected to watch.\u201cIt\u2019s not good right now,\u201d Nafti said. \u201cBut it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying consistently in all my books and articles. I have no regrets, none at all.\u201d",
        "Here\u2019s how things stand on Thursday, March 7, 2024:",
        "She raised concerns about his age. His mental state. His capacity for leadership when faced with 91 criminal charges.And yet, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley could not overcome former President Donald Trump in the race for the United States presidency. On Wednesday, she announced she was suspending her campaign, clearing the way for Trump to receive the Republican Party nomination.Analysts, however, say her long-shot bid reflects how ironclad Trump\u2019s hold over the party has become. Nevertheless, her campaign gave voice to the anxieties some Republicans harbour.\u201cThere is some angst in elite Republican circles that Trump comes with a lot of baggage and that they could do better with someone else,\u201d Osita Nwanevu, a writer on US politics, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHaley was the candidate who embodied that concern, that sticking with Trump could hurt the party.\u201dBut that message failed to resonate beyond pockets of moderate voters. Haley announced her campaign\u2019s suspension in the aftermath of the Super Tuesday primary votes. With 15 states up for grabs, she only managed to secure one: left-leaning Vermont.Haley ultimately finished the race on Wednesday with just 89 party delegates to Trump\u2019s 995. Delegates ultimately decide who receives the party nomination.\u201cIn all likelihood, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee when our party convention meets in July. I congratulate him and wish him well,\u201d Haley said in her announcement on Wednesday.However, Haley stopped short of endorsing Trump, instead calling on him to win over voters who may have doubts about his candidacy.\u201cIt is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond who did not support him,\u201d she said.A former governor of South Carolina, Haley outlasted all other major Republican opponents, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, to face Trump one-on-one in the primaries.But even her exit speech reflected the difficult balancing act she was forced to walk. Experts say she tried to appeal to moderates without alienating party voters for whom loyalty to Trump has become an article of faith.Throughout the race, Trump pilloried Haley \u2014 a former member of his administration \u2014 as a \u201cbirdbrain\u201d and a \u201cRepublican in name only\u201d, or RINO. He celebrated her Super Tuesday losses with a post on social media, revisiting a frequent accusation that she represented Democratic interests.\u201cNikki Haley got TROUNCED last night, in record setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats, for reasons unknown, are allowed to vote in Vermont, and various other Republican Primaries,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cMuch of her money came from Radical Left Democrats.\u201dExperts have observed that Trump\u2019s rhetoric towards Haley has been echoed among his base of supporters, who have questioned her political credentials \u2014 and even her citizenship as an American of Indian heritage.Trump, for example, raised doubts about whether she was even born in the United States, a conspiracy theory he also pushed during the presidency of Democrat Barack Obama.\u201cThe level of negativity towards her from Trump and his supporters is usually reserved for members of opposing political parties,\u201d Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHer challenge to Trump was met with real vitriol.\u201dBut while Haley has been able to project herself as a moderate alternative to Trump, she has consistently staked out right-wing positions on issues such as immigration, abortion and foreign policy.During a Republican primary debate earlier this year, Haley leaned into far-right talking points. \u201cYou have to deport them,\u201d she said at one point of the roughly 10 million undocumented immigrants in the US.She has also pushed to raise the country\u2019s retirement age and called Democratic legislation addressing climate change a \u201ccommunist manifesto\u201d.Her unconditional support for Israel \u2014 even amid its deadly campaign in Gaza \u2014 has also been a hallmark of her campaign. In a recent interview, she said that displaced Palestinians in Gaza should be resettled in Arab countries.Still, she did stake out positions that put her at odds with some members of her party, particularly Trump.Her firm support for Ukraine, for example, drew ire from the party\u2019s right flank, and she has criticised Trump\u2019s actions on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the US Capitol to overturn the 2020 election results.\u201cI think he should have stopped it when it started,\u201d she told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.But Haley acknowledged the political costs of making those kinds of criticisms. Speaking to reporters in 2015, she addressed the backlash she and others faced from Trump.\u201cEvery time someone criticises him, he goes and makes a political attack back,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are as Republicans. That\u2019s not what we do.\u201dWith Haley now out of the presidential race, President Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent, has already made a play for the moderate voters who backed her campaign.In a statement on Wednesday, Biden praised Haley for being willing to \u201cspeak the truth about Donald Trump\u201d. He also courted her supporters, saying there is \u201ca place for them in my campaign\u201d.A recent Quinnipiac poll found that, of the Republicans who voted for Haley, only 37 percent said they would cast their ballot for Biden if she dropped out. Nearly half, however, pledged to back Trump.Nwanevu, the political writer, said that reflected Trump\u2019s steadfast dominance in the Republican field. Since emerging as an outsider candidate in 2016 with no political experience, Trump has exerted increasing dominance over the Republican Party \u2014 and voters have rallied behind him.\u201cTrump is tremendously popular among Republican voters, more so than when he ran in 2016 when he won most primaries without a majority of the vote,\u201d Nwanevu told Al Jazeera.Recent poll numbers have also buoyed Trump\u2019s campaign. A March poll from the New York Times and Siena College showed that Trump had a lead over Biden of 48 percent to 43 percent. Biden\u2019s popularity, meanwhile, has slumped to record lows.Those numbers have proven unifying for Republicans. Kousser, the political science professor, told Al Jazeera that Biden\u2019s low approval ratings would reassure some Republican voters that the former president has the capacity to win, even with his abrasive public persona and legal baggage.\u201cThey don\u2019t feel that they have to choose between the candidate closest to their heart and someone who can win in November,\u201d he said.I end my campaign with the same words I began it from the Book of Joshua. I direct them to all Americans, but especially to so many of the women and girls out there who put their faith in our campaign.Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged. For God\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XAwgOGzKdy\u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) March 6, 2024Republican officials have likewise lined up behind Trump\u2019s candidacy.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, has previously slammed Trump over his actions on January 6. But on\u00a0Wednesday, McConnell again offered his support to Trump despite their stormy personal relationship.\u201cIt should come as no surprise that, as nominee, he will have my support,\u201d McConnell said.Nwanevu, the writer, said that even establishment Republicans who have qualms with Trump have come to see him as a vessel to advance traditional conservative priorities.\u201cThe Republican establishment has largely brought Trump on board with their main policy goals. During his first term, you didn\u2019t see the big realignment on trade he promised. He cut taxes, pushed deregulation and appointed conservative justices to the Supreme Court,\u201d he explained.\u201cThere are still some in the party who feel they could be accomplishing more on the policy front without Trump looming over them, but those forces in the party have largely resigned themselves and realised they aren\u2019t able to displace him.\u201dIn her exit speech, Haley\u00a0again took on the cadence of a moderate, a signal that she may still believe that there is a future for her in the party, should Trump lose again in 2024.\u201cAt its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away,\u201d Haley said in her remarks on Wednesday. \u201cAnd our conservative cause badly needs more people.\u201d"
